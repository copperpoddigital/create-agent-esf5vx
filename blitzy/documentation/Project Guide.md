# PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Document Management and AI Chatbot System is a comprehensive backend solution designed to provide intelligent document search and retrieval capabilities through a vector database and AI-powered chatbot. This system addresses the growing need for efficient knowledge management and information retrieval in organizations by combining document storage with natural language processing capabilities.

## Core Functionality

The system provides a robust API-based solution with four primary capabilities:

1. **Document Management**: Users can upload, list, retrieve, and delete PDF documents. The system processes these documents by extracting text, chunking content into manageable segments, and generating vector embeddings for semantic search.

2. **Vector-Based Search**: The system leverages FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to store document embeddings and perform efficient similarity searches. This enables semantic understanding of queries beyond simple keyword matching.

3. **AI-Powered Responses**: When users submit queries, the system identifies the most relevant document segments and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate contextual responses based on the document content.

4. **Reinforcement Learning**: The system collects user feedback on responses and implements a basic reinforcement learning mechanism to improve response quality over time.

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with clear component boundaries:

- **API Layer**: FastAPI-based REST API endpoints for client interaction
- **Document Processor**: Extracts text from PDFs and generates vector embeddings
- **Vector Engine**: Manages FAISS index for similarity search
- **LLM Connector**: Interfaces with OpenAI API for response generation
- **Feedback Manager**: Collects and processes user feedback
- **Data Store**: PostgreSQL database for metadata and SQLAlchemy ORM

While initially implemented as a monolithic application, the architecture is designed with clear separation of concerns to facilitate future migration to microservices if needed.

## Technology Stack

The system is built using modern technologies:

- **Backend**: Python 3.10+, FastAPI 0.95.0+
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+, SQLAlchemy 2.0.0+
- **Vector Storage**: FAISS 1.7.4+
- **Document Processing**: PyMuPDF 1.21.0+
- **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers 2.2.2+
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI API
- **Authentication**: JWT with PyJWT 2.6.0+

## Key Workflows

The system implements three primary workflows:

1. **Document Processing Flow**: Documents are uploaded, stored, processed to extract text, chunked into segments, and converted to vector embeddings for storage in FAISS.

2. **Query and Response Flow**: User queries are converted to vector embeddings, similar documents are retrieved from FAISS, relevant context is prepared, and an AI-generated response is created using the LLM.

3. **Feedback and Learning Flow**: Users provide feedback on responses, which is collected and periodically processed to improve the system's response generation capabilities.

## Security and Compliance

The system implements comprehensive security measures:

- JWT-based authentication for API access
- Role-based access control (admin and regular users)
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Input validation using Pydantic models
- Secure handling of sensitive configuration values

## Deployment and Scalability

The system is containerized using Docker for consistent deployment across environments. It supports horizontal scaling through multiple API containers behind a load balancer, with separate persistence layers for PostgreSQL, FAISS, and document storage.

The architecture allows for both vertical scaling (increasing resources per instance) and horizontal scaling (adding more instances) to handle growing workloads.

## Integration Points

The system exposes a comprehensive REST API for client integration, with endpoints for:

- Document management (`/documents/*`)
- Vector search and chatbot interaction (`/query/*`)
- Feedback collection (`/feedback/*`)
- Authentication (`/auth/*`)

This API-first design enables flexibility in client implementation and facilitates integration with other systems.

## Detailed Component Explanations

### 1. Document Management Flow

The document management flow involves several steps:

1. **Document Upload**:
   - User uploads a PDF document through the API
   - The system validates the file format and size
   - The file is stored in the file storage system
   - A document record is created in the database with "processing" status
   - A background task is triggered to process the document

2. **Document Processing**:
   - The document processor extracts text from the PDF
   - The text is split into manageable chunks
   - Vector embeddings are generated for each chunk
   - Embeddings are stored in the FAISS vector database
   - Document status is updated to "available"

3. **Document Retrieval**:
   - Users can list and retrieve documents
   - Access control ensures users can only access their own documents (unless admin)
   - Document metadata and content chunks can be retrieved

4. **Document Deletion**:
   - Soft deletion marks documents as deleted but retains data
   - Hard deletion (admin only) permanently removes the document, chunks, and files

### 2. Vector Search and Query Flow

The vector search and query flow involves:

1. **Query Submission**:
   - User submits a natural language query
   - The system generates a vector embedding for the query
   - FAISS performs similarity search to find relevant document chunks
   - Relevant chunks are retrieved from the database

2. **Response Generation**:
   - The LLM service constructs a prompt with the query and relevant document chunks
   - The prompt is sent to the language model (OpenAI)
   - The language model generates a contextual response
   - The response and query are stored in the database

3. **Result Retrieval**:
   - Users can retrieve previous queries and responses
   - Access control ensures users can only access their own queries (unless admin)

### 3. Feedback and Reinforcement Learning Flow

The feedback and reinforcement learning flow involves:

1. **Feedback Collection**:
   - Users provide ratings and comments on responses
   - Feedback is stored in the database linked to the query

2. **Feedback Processing**:
   - The feedback processor aggregates feedback data
   - Reinforcement learning algorithms analyze patterns
   - Response generation is improved based on feedback

### 4. Authentication and Authorization Flow

The authentication and authorization flow involves:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users provide credentials to obtain a JWT token
   - The token contains user ID, role, and expiration time
   - All API requests include the token for authentication

2. **Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control restricts access to endpoints
   - Resource-based authorization ensures users can only access their own resources
   - Admins have broader access to all resources

# Lint code
poetry run flake8 app tests

# Type check
poetry run mypy app
```

### Documentation Requirements

All modules, classes, methods, and functions must have docstrings following the Google style:

```python
def process_document(document_id: str, extract_text: bool = True) -> bool:
    """Process a document and generate vector embeddings.
    
    This function retrieves a document, extracts its text content,
    and generates vector embeddings for search functionality.
    
    Args:
        document_id: The unique identifier of the document to process
        extract_text: Whether to extract text from the document
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if processing was successful, False otherwise
        
    Raises:
        DocumentNotFoundError: If the document doesn't exist
        ProcessingError: If text extraction or embedding generation fails
    """
    # Implementation
```

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

The project uses a simplified Git Flow branching strategy:

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Feature branches
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches

Feature and bugfix branches should be created from `develop` and merged back to `develop` when complete.

### Commit Guidelines

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

1. Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
2. First line is a concise summary (50 chars or less)
3. Followed by a blank line
4. Followed by a detailed description if necessary
5. Reference issue numbers when applicable

Example:
```
Add vector search caching for improved performance

Implement LRU cache for vector search results to reduce
redundant FAISS operations and improve query response time.
Cache is configurable with TTL and size limits.

Resolves #123
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a pull request with a clear description of changes
2. Ensure all CI checks pass
3. Request code review from team members
4. Address review feedback
5. Merge only when approved and all checks pass

poetry run pytest -m unit
poetry run pytest -m integration

# Run tests in a specific file
poetry run pytest tests/unit/api/test_auth.py
```

### Test-Driven Development

Follow the TDD workflow:

1. Write a test that defines a function or improvement
2. Run the test to verify it fails
3. Write the minimum code to make the test pass
4. Run the test to verify it passes
5. Refactor the code while keeping the test passing

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD with the following workflows:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**
   - Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
   - Unit and integration tests
   - Security scans
   - Docker image building

2. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**
   - Deployment to development environment
   - Deployment to staging environment
   - Manual approval for production deployment
   - Automated rollback on failure

### Quality Gates

The CI pipeline enforces several quality gates:

| Gate | Criteria | Action on Failure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code Quality | 0 linting errors, code formatting compliance | Block deployment |
| Unit Tests | 100% pass rate, minimum 80% coverage | Block deployment |
| Integration Tests | 100% pass rate | Block deployment |
| Security Scan | No critical or high vulnerabilities | Block deployment |

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding Dependencies

To add new dependencies to the project:

```bash
poetry add package-name  # For production dependencies
poetry add --dev package-name  # For development dependencies
```

### Database Migrations

If you make changes to the database models, generate new migrations:

```bash
poetry run python -m scripts.generate_migrations
poetry run alembic upgrade head
```

### Creating an Admin User

Create an admin user for testing:

```bash
poetry run python -m scripts.create_admin
```

### Rebuilding Vector Index

If you need to rebuild the vector index:

```bash
poetry run python -m scripts.rebuild_index
```

## Security Practices

### Authentication and Authorization

- Use JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
- Implement proper password hashing with Passlib
- Apply the principle of least privilege
- Use role-based access control

### Input Validation and Sanitization

- Use Pydantic models for request validation
- Implement additional validation for complex requirements
- Sanitize data before using it in database queries or external APIs
- Be particularly careful with file uploads

### Secure File Handling

- Validate file types and sizes before processing
- Store files outside the web root
- Use secure file naming to prevent path traversal
- Scan uploaded files for malware when possible

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

- **Database connection errors**: Check your PostgreSQL service is running and credentials are correct in .env
- **FAISS index errors**: Ensure the vector_indices directory exists and has write permissions
- **OpenAI API errors**: Verify your API key is valid and properly set in .env
- **Docker permission issues**: You may need to run Docker commands with sudo on Linux
