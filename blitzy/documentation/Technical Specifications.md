## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### 5.1.1 System Overview

The Document Management and AI Chatbot System follows a layered architecture with a modular design to support document processing, vector search, and AI-powered responses. The system adopts a monolithic deployment approach initially, with clear component boundaries to facilitate future migration to microservices if needed.

Key architectural principles include:

- **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between document management, vector search, and AI response generation
- **API-first design**: All functionality exposed through well-defined REST APIs
- **Stateless processing**: Core processing components maintain minimal state for scalability
- **Asynchronous processing**: Document processing and vector generation handled asynchronously
- **Data isolation**: Clear separation between document storage, vector database, and metadata

System boundaries are defined by the FastAPI application, which serves as the entry point for all client interactions. Major interfaces include the Document Management API, Vector Search API, and Reinforcement Learning API, all exposed as RESTful endpoints.

#### 5.1.2 Core Components Table

| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Critical Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API Layer | Handle HTTP requests, authentication, and routing | FastAPI, Pydantic, JWT | Request validation, error handling, authentication |
| Document Processor | Extract text from PDFs and prepare for vectorization | PyMuPDF, asyncio | Document size limits, text extraction quality |
| Vector Engine | Generate and store document embeddings, perform similarity search | FAISS, Sentence Transformers | Vector quality, search performance, index management |
| LLM Connector | Interface with language models for response generation | OpenAI API or alternative LLM | Token limits, prompt engineering, response quality |
| Feedback Manager | Collect and process user feedback for reinforcement learning | SQLAlchemy, Ray RLlib | Feedback quality, learning rate, model improvement |
| Data Store | Manage document metadata and system state | PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy | Data consistency, query performance |

#### 5.1.3 Data Flow Description

The primary data flow begins with document upload, where PDFs are processed through the Document Processor to extract text. The extracted text is then passed to the Vector Engine, which generates embeddings using Sentence Transformers and stores them in the FAISS index. Document metadata is stored in PostgreSQL through the Data Store component.

For queries, user input is processed by the API Layer and passed to the Vector Engine, which generates a query embedding and performs similarity search in FAISS. The most relevant document segments are retrieved and combined with the original query to form a prompt for the LLM Connector. The LLM generates a response based on the document context, which is returned to the user along with references to the source documents.

Feedback flows from the API Layer to the Feedback Manager, which stores user ratings and uses them to periodically update the response generation process through reinforcement learning techniques.

Data transformation occurs primarily at three points:

1. Document text extraction (PDF to plain text)
2. Vector embedding generation (text to vector embeddings)
3. Context preparation (document segments to LLM prompt)

#### 5.1.4 External Integration Points

| System Name | Integration Type | Data Exchange Pattern | Protocol/Format | SLA Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI API | Service API | Request-Response | HTTPS/JSON | Response time \< 2.5s, 99.9% availability |
| File Storage | Storage Service | Write-Read | File System API | Read/Write latency \< 100ms |
| PostgreSQL | Database | CRUD Operations | SQL/TCP | Query response \< 100ms, 99.99% availability |

### 5.3 TECHNICAL DECISIONS

#### 5.3.1 Architecture Style Decisions

| Decision | Options Considered | Selected Approach | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overall Architecture | Microservices, Monolithic, Serverless | Monolithic with modular components | Simplifies initial development while allowing future decomposition into microservices |
| API Design | REST, GraphQL, gRPC | REST API with JSON | Widely supported, simple to implement, good tooling support |
| Processing Model | Synchronous, Asynchronous | Hybrid (sync API, async processing) | Provides responsive API while handling resource-intensive tasks asynchronously |
| Deployment Strategy | Containerized, VM-based, Serverless | Containerized application | Offers deployment flexibility and environment consistency |

The monolithic architecture with clear component boundaries was selected to balance development speed with future scalability. The system is designed with well-defined interfaces between components, allowing for potential extraction into microservices as the system grows. REST APIs provide a familiar interface for clients while maintaining simplicity in implementation.

        D --> H[Pro: Non-blocking]
        D --> I[Con: Complex state management]
        
        E --> J[Pro: Responsive API with background processing]
        E --> K[Con: Moderate complexity]
        
        J --> L[Selected: Hybrid Approach]
    end
```

#### 5.3.2 Communication Pattern Choices

| Pattern | Use Case | Implementation | Benefits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Request-Response | API interactions | FastAPI HTTP endpoints | Simplicity, familiar pattern for clients |
| Asynchronous Processing | Document processing | Background tasks with FastAPI | Non-blocking API responses for long-running tasks |
| Caching | Frequent queries | In-memory cache with TTL | Reduced latency, lower LLM API costs |
| Batching | Vector operations | Batch processing of embeddings | Improved throughput for vector operations |

The system primarily uses request-response patterns for API interactions, with asynchronous processing for resource-intensive operations like document processing and vector generation. This hybrid approach maintains responsiveness while efficiently handling computationally expensive tasks.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Document Metadata | PostgreSQL | ACID compliance, relational queries | Connection pooling, indexing strategy |
| Vector Embeddings | FAISS | Optimized for vector similarity search | Index type selection, memory requirements |
| Original Documents | File System | Simple, efficient for binary data | Backup strategy, file organization |
| User Queries/Responses | PostgreSQL | Relational structure, query capabilities | Data retention policy, archiving strategy |

PostgreSQL was selected for structured data due to its reliability, ACID compliance, and robust query capabilities. FAISS provides specialized vector storage optimized for similarity search, which is critical for the core search functionality. The file system offers simple, efficient storage for the original document files.

#### 5.3.4 Caching Strategy Justification

| Cache Type | Implementation | Purpose | Invalidation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Query Results | In-memory cache | Reduce duplicate processing | Time-based expiration (TTL) |
| Vector Embeddings | FAISS in-memory index | Fast vector similarity search | Manual invalidation on document updates |
| Document Metadata | Database query cache | Reduce database load | Automatic invalidation on updates |
| LLM Responses | Response cache for identical queries | Reduce API costs | Time-based expiration (TTL) |

Caching is implemented at multiple levels to improve performance and reduce costs. Query results and LLM responses use time-based expiration to balance freshness with performance. Vector embeddings are kept in memory for fast search operations, with manual invalidation when documents are updated or deleted.

#### 5.3.5 Security Mechanism Selection

| Security Concern | Selected Mechanism | Implementation | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication | JWT Tokens | PyJWT with secure key | Stateless, scalable authentication |
| Authorization | Role-based access control | FastAPI dependency injection | Granular permission control |
| Data Protection | TLS encryption | HTTPS for all API endpoints | Industry standard for data in transit |
| Input Validation | Schema validation | Pydantic models | Prevents injection attacks |
| File Security | Content validation | File type checking, size limits | Prevents malicious uploads |

JWT-based authentication provides a stateless, scalable approach to user authentication. Role-based access control implemented through FastAPI dependencies enables granular permission management. All data in transit is protected using TLS encryption, and input validation using Pydantic models prevents common injection attacks.

### 5.4 CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

#### 5.4.1 Monitoring and Observability Approach

The system implements a comprehensive monitoring strategy focusing on:

- **API Performance Metrics**: Response times, error rates, and request volumes
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and disk usage
- **Vector Search Performance**: Search latency and relevance scores
- **LLM Integration**: Response generation time and token usage
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback metrics and response quality

Implementation includes:

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Health check endpoints for each component
- Custom metrics for vector search quality

#### 5.4.2 Logging and Tracing Strategy

| Log Type | Information Captured | Storage | Retention |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Application Logs | API requests, errors, processing events | Structured JSON | 30 days |
| Performance Logs | Timing data, resource usage | Time-series database | 14 days |
| Security Logs | Authentication events, access attempts | Secure log storage | 90 days |
| Audit Logs | Document operations, user actions | Append-only storage | 1 year |

The logging strategy uses structured JSON logs with correlation IDs to track requests across components. Log levels are configurable, with production environments defaulting to INFO level. Sensitive information is redacted from logs to maintain security and compliance.

#### 5.4.3 Error Handling Patterns

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Error Occurs] --> B{Error Type}
    
    B -->|Validation Error| C[Return 400 Bad Request]
    C --> C1[Log validation details]
    
    B -->|Authentication Error| D[Return 401 Unauthorized]
    D --> D1[Log authentication failure]
    
    B -->|Authorization Error| E[Return 403 Forbidden]
    E --> E1[Log access attempt]
    
    B -->|Resource Not Found| F[Return 404 Not Found]
    F --> F1[Log resource request]
    
    B -->|Processing Error| G[Return 422 Unprocessable Entity]
    G --> G1[Log processing details]
    G1 --> G2{Retryable?}
    G2 -->|Yes| G3[Add retry header]
    G2 -->|No| G4[Log permanent failure]
    
    B -->|External Service Error| H[Return 503 Service Unavailable]
    H --> H1[Log service dependency failure]
    H1 --> H2[Implement circuit breaker]
    
    B -->|Internal Error| I[Return 500 Internal Server Error]
    I --> I1[Log detailed error]
    I1 --> I2[Alert operations team]
```

The system implements a consistent error handling pattern across all components:

- **Structured Error Responses**: All errors return a consistent JSON structure with error code, message, and details
- **Appropriate HTTP Status Codes**: Using standard HTTP status codes for different error types
- **Detailed Logging**: All errors are logged with context information for troubleshooting
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues to function with reduced capabilities when non-critical components fail
- **Circuit Breakers**: Implemented for external service dependencies to prevent cascading failures

#### 5.4.4 Authentication and Authorization Framework

The authentication and authorization framework is based on JWT tokens with role-based access control:

- **Authentication Flow**:

  - Users authenticate with credentials to receive a JWT token
  - Token contains user ID, roles, and expiration time
  - All API requests include the token in the Authorization header
  - Tokens are validated for authenticity and expiration

- **Authorization Model**:

  - Role-based permissions (Admin, Regular User)
  - Resource-based access control for documents
  - Permission checks implemented as FastAPI dependencies
  - Granular API endpoint protection

- **Security Considerations**:

  - Short token expiration (1 hour)
  - Refresh token pattern for extended sessions
  - Token revocation capability for security incidents
  - Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

#### 5.4.5 Performance Requirements and SLAs

| Component | Performance Metric | Target SLA | Measurement Method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Document Upload | Processing Time | \< 10s for 10MB document | API response timing |
| Vector Search | Query Response Time | \< 3s for standard queries | API response timing |
| Document Listing | Response Time | \< 1s for up to 1000 documents | API response timing |
| LLM Response | Generation Time | \< 2.5s | Component timing logs |
| Overall System | Availability | 99.9% uptime | Health check monitoring |

Performance is monitored continuously through:

- API response time metrics
- Component-level timing logs
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Periodic load testing
- User feedback on response quality

#### 5.4.6 Disaster Recovery Procedures

The disaster recovery strategy focuses on data protection and service restoration:

- **Data Backup**:

  - PostgreSQL: Daily full backups, hourly incremental backups
  - FAISS Index: Daily snapshots
  - Document Storage: Redundant storage with daily backups
  - Configuration: Version-controlled and backed up

- **Recovery Procedures**:

  - Database Restoration: Automated restore from latest backup
  - Vector Index Rebuild: Can be reconstructed from document storage if needed
  - Application Deployment: Automated deployment from version control
  - Configuration Restoration: Applied from backed-up configuration

- **Recovery Time Objectives**:

  - Database: \< 1 hour
  - Vector Index: \< 2 hours
  - Full System: \< 4 hours

- **Testing**:

  - Quarterly disaster recovery drills
  - Automated backup verification
  - Restoration testing in staging environment

1. **System Prompt:**

   ```
   You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided document context.
   Only use information from the provided context to answer the question.
   If the context doesn't contain relevant information, say "I don't have enough information to answer this question."
   Provide specific references to the documents you used in your answer.
   ```

2. **User Prompt Template:**

   ```
   Context:
   {context}
   
   Question: {query}
   ```

#### 6.4.3 Response Quality Metrics

The system tracks several metrics to evaluate and improve response quality:

| Metric | Measurement Method | Target Value |

#### 6.6.3 Authorization Model

The authorization model defines the access control structure for the system.

**Role Definitions:**

| Role | Description | Permissions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin | System administrator | All operations, user management |
| Regular User | Standard system user | Document upload, search, feedback |
| Guest | Unauthenticated user | Limited search only |

**Permission Matrix:**

| Endpoint | Admin | Regular User | Guest |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST /documents/upload | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| GET /documents/list | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| GET /documents/{id} | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| DELETE /documents/{id} | ✓ | ✓ (own docs) | ✗ |
| POST /query | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (limited) |
| GET /query/{id} | ✓ | ✓ (own queries) | ✗ |
| POST /feedback | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| GET /feedback/{id} | ✓ | ✓ (own feedback) | ✗ |
| POST /reinforce | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| User management | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |

**Implementation Approach:**

The authorization system is implemented using FastAPI's dependency injection system, with role-based middleware that checks permissions before processing requests.

```python
# Pseudocode for authorization middleware
def require_permission(permission):
    def dependency(token: str = Depends(get_token)):
        payload = verify_token(token)
        user_roles = get_user_roles(payload["sub"])
        if has_permission(user_roles, permission):
            return True
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Permission denied")
    return dependency

# Usage in API endpoint
@app.post("/documents/upload")
async def upload_document(file: UploadFile, _=Depends(require_permission("document:upload"))):
    # Implementation
```

## 6.1 CORE SERVICES ARCHITECTURE

While this system is initially implemented as a monolithic application, it is designed with clear component boundaries and service-oriented principles to facilitate future scalability. This section outlines the architecture of core services, their interactions, and strategies for ensuring system resilience and scalability.

### 6.1.1 SERVICE COMPONENTS

#### Service Boundaries and Responsibilities

| Service Component | Primary Responsibilities | Key Interfaces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Document Service | Document upload, processing, and management | `/documents/*` endpoints |
| Vector Search Service | Query processing and vector similarity search | `/query/*` endpoints |
| Feedback Service | User feedback collection and reinforcement learning | `/feedback/*`, `/reinforce` endpoints |
| Authentication Service | User authentication and authorization | JWT token generation and validation |

Each service component is implemented as a module within the monolithic application but with clear boundaries to enable future extraction into microservices.

#### Inter-Service Communication Patterns

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[Client Applications] --> API[API Gateway]
    
    subgraph "Core Service Components"
        API --> DS[Document Service]
        API --> VS[Vector Search Service]
        API --> FS[Feedback Service]
        API --> AS[Authentication Service]
        
        DS <--> VS
        VS <--> FS
        AS <-.-> DS
        AS <-.-> VS
        AS <-.-> FS
    end
    
    DS <--> DB[(PostgreSQL)]
    DS <--> FileStore[(File Storage)]
    VS <--> VectorDB[(FAISS)]
    VS <--> LLM[LLM Service]
    FS <--> DB
    AS <--> DB
    
    classDef service fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    class DS,VS,FS,AS service
```

The system uses the following communication patterns:

| Pattern | Implementation | Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Synchronous Request-Response | Direct function calls | Real-time operations requiring immediate response |
| Asynchronous Processing | Background tasks | Document processing, vector generation |
| Event-Driven | Internal event bus | Notifications between components (e.g., document processed) |

#### Service Discovery and Load Balancing

In the monolithic implementation, service discovery is handled through direct module imports. For future microservice deployment, the following strategies are planned:

| Mechanism | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service Registry | Consul or etcd | Dynamic service discovery |
| Load Balancing | Nginx or Traefik | Request distribution across service instances |
| Health Checks | Periodic ping endpoints | Service availability monitoring |

#### Circuit Breaker and Retry Mechanisms

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Failure threshold exceeded
    Open --> HalfOpen: Timeout period elapsed
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Success threshold met
    HalfOpen --> Open: Failure occurs
    
    state Closed {
        [*] --> Normal
        Normal --> Counting: Failure occurs
        Counting --> Normal: Success occurs
        Counting --> [*]: Threshold reached
    }
```

The system implements circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies:

| Component | Circuit Breaker Implementation | Retry Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LLM Service | Exponential backoff with jitter | 3 retries with increasing delays |
| Database Operations | Connection pooling with timeout | Immediate retry once, then fail |
| FAISS Operations | Timeout with fallback to cache | No retry, use cached results |

### 6.1.2 SCALABILITY DESIGN

#### Scaling Approach

The system is designed to scale both horizontally and vertically:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    LB[Load Balancer] --> API1[API Instance 1]
    LB --> API2[API Instance 2]
    LB --> API3[API Instance 3]
    
    subgraph "Shared Resources"
        DB[(PostgreSQL)]
        FS[(File Storage)]
        FAISS[(FAISS Vector DB)]
    end
    
    API1 --> DB
    API1 --> FS
    API1 --> FAISS
    
    API2 --> DB
    API2 --> FS
    API2 --> FAISS
    
    API3 --> DB
    API3 --> FS
    API3 --> FAISS
```

| Scaling Dimension | Strategy | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Horizontal Scaling | Add more API instances | Deploy behind load balancer with sticky sessions |
| Vertical Scaling | Increase resources per instance | Allocate more CPU/memory to compute-intensive components |
| Database Scaling | Connection pooling and read replicas | Implement for high query volumes |
| FAISS Scaling | Sharded indices | Partition vector database for large document collections |

#### Auto-Scaling Triggers

The system monitors the following metrics to trigger scaling operations:

| Metric | Threshold | Scaling Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU Utilization | \>70% for 5 minutes | Scale out by adding one instance |
| Memory Usage | \>80% for 5 minutes | Scale up by increasing memory allocation |
| Request Queue Length | \>100 requests | Scale out by adding one instance |
| Response Time | \>2 seconds average | Scale out or optimize database queries |

#### Performance Optimization Techniques

The system implements several performance optimization strategies:

1. **Query Optimization**:

   - Caching frequent queries
   - Optimized vector search parameters
   - Database query optimization

2. **Resource Management**:

   - Connection pooling for database and LLM service
   - Batch processing for document vectorization
   - Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations

3. **Data Access Patterns**:

   - Read-heavy optimizations for document retrieval
   - Write-optimized storage for feedback collection
   - Efficient vector indexing for similarity search

### 6.1.3 RESILIENCE PATTERNS

#### Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[Client] --> LB[Load Balancer]
    LB --> API1[API Instance 1]
    LB --> API2[API Instance 2]
    
    API1 --> CB1[Circuit Breaker]
    API2 --> CB2[Circuit Breaker]
    
    CB1 --> LLM[LLM Service]
    CB2 --> LLM
    
    API1 --> DB[(Primary DB)]
    API2 --> DB
    
    DB -.-> DBR[(Replica DB)]
    
    subgraph "Fallback Mechanisms"
        LLM -.-> Cache[Response Cache]
        DB -.-> DBR
    end
```

The system implements the following fault tolerance mechanisms:

| Component | Fault Tolerance Mechanism | Fallback Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API Layer | Multiple instances behind load balancer | Automatic failover to healthy instances |
| Database | Connection pooling with timeout handling | Retry with exponential backoff |
| LLM Service | Circuit breaker with fallback | Use cached responses or simplified model |
| FAISS | In-memory with periodic persistence | Rebuild from document storage if corrupted |

#### Disaster Recovery Procedures

The system implements a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy:

1. **Data Backup**:

   - Daily database backups
   - FAISS index snapshots
   - Document storage replication

2. **Recovery Procedures**:

   - Database restoration from latest backup
   - FAISS index reconstruction from document storage
   - Automated deployment from version control

3. **Recovery Time Objectives**:

   - Database: \< 1 hour
   - Vector Index: \< 2 hours
   - Full System: \< 4 hours

#### Service Degradation Policies

When facing resource constraints or component failures, the system implements graceful degradation:

| Failure Scenario | Degradation Policy | User Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LLM Service Unavailable | Fall back to basic keyword search | Less contextual responses |
| FAISS Overloaded | Reduce search precision | Slightly less relevant results |
| Database Slow | Increase caching, reduce result set size | Limited document metadata |
| High Request Volume | Implement request throttling | Increased response times |

### 6.1.4 IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

While the initial implementation is monolithic, the system is designed with future scalability in mind:

1. **Modular Design**:

   - Clear separation of concerns between components
   - Well-defined interfaces between modules
   - Minimal dependencies between service boundaries

2. **Deployment Strategy**:

   - Containerized application using Docker
   - Environment-specific configuration
   - CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

3. **Monitoring and Observability**:

   - Comprehensive logging with correlation IDs
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Health check endpoints for each component

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the initial monolithic implementation while enabling future migration to a microservice architecture as system requirements evolve.

## 6.2 DATABASE DESIGN

### 6.2.1 SCHEMA DESIGN

The database design for the Document Management and AI Chatbot System incorporates both relational database (PostgreSQL) and vector database (FAISS) components to efficiently store and retrieve document content, metadata, and vector embeddings.

#### Entity Relationships

#### Data Models and Structures

| Entity | Description | Primary Key | Foreign Keys |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| USERS | Stores user authentication and role information | id (UUID) | None |
| DOCUMENTS | Stores document metadata and file location | id (UUID) | uploader_id → USERS.id |

    rating INTEGER NOT NULL,
    comments TEXT,
    feedback_time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT valid_rating CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5)
);
```

#### Indexing Strategy

| Table | Index Name | Columns | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| USERS | users_username_idx | username | B-tree | Fast lookup by username during authentication |
| USERS | users_email_idx | email | B-tree | Fast lookup by email for account management |
| DOCUMENTS | documents_uploader_id_idx | uploader_id | B-tree | Fast retrieval of documents by uploader |
| DOCUMENTS | documents_upload_date_idx | upload_date | B-tree | Efficient sorting and filtering by upload date |
| DOCUMENT_CHUNKS | document_chunks_document_id_idx | document_id | B-tree | Fast retrieval of chunks for a document |
| DOCUMENT_CHUNKS | document_chunks_embedding_id_idx | embedding_id | B-tree | Lookup chunks by embedding ID |
| QUERIES | queries_user_id_idx | user_id | B-tree | Fast retrieval of queries by user |
| QUERIES | queries_query_time_idx | query_time | B-tree | Efficient sorting and filtering by query time |
| FEEDBACK | feedback_query_id_idx | query_id | B-tree | Fast retrieval of feedback for a query |
| FEEDBACK | feedback_user_id_idx | user_id | B-tree | Fast retrieval of feedback by user |

#### Partitioning Approach

For the initial implementation, table partitioning will not be implemented as the expected data volume does not warrant it. However, the system is designed to support future partitioning if needed:

| Table | Potential Partitioning Strategy | Partition Key | Implementation Timeline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DOCUMENTS | Range partitioning | upload_date | When document count exceeds 1 million |
| DOCUMENT_CHUNKS | List partitioning | document_id | When chunk count exceeds 10 million |
| QUERIES | Range partitioning | query_time | When query count exceeds 5 million |

#### Replication Configuration

```mermaid
graph TD
    PrimaryDB[(Primary PostgreSQL)] --> ReplicaDB1[(Read Replica 1)]
    PrimaryDB --> ReplicaDB2[(Read Replica 2)]
    
    subgraph "Write Operations"
        Client1[Client] -->|Writes| PrimaryDB
    end
    
    subgraph "Read Operations"
        Client2[Client] -->|Reads| LoadBalancer[Load Balancer]
        LoadBalancer -->|Distribute Reads| ReplicaDB1
        LoadBalancer -->|Distribute Reads| ReplicaDB2
    end
```

The PostgreSQL database will be configured with:

1. **Primary-Replica Setup**:

   - One primary database for all write operations
   - Two read replicas for distributing read queries
   - Synchronous replication for the primary replica to ensure data consistency
   - Asynchronous replication for secondary replicas to optimize performance

2. **Connection Distribution**:

   - Write operations directed to the primary database
   - Read operations distributed across replicas using connection pooling
   - Automatic failover configuration using PostgreSQL's streaming replication

#### Backup Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    PrimaryDB[(Primary PostgreSQL)] -->|Daily Full Backup| S3[S3 Bucket]
    PrimaryDB -->|Continuous WAL Archiving| WAL[WAL Archive]
    WAL -->|Hourly Transfer| S3
    
    S3 -->|Retention Policy| LongTerm[Long-term Storage]
    
    subgraph "Backup Verification"
        S3 -->|Weekly| TestRestore[Test Restore]
        TestRestore -->|Verify| Validation[Validation Process]
    end
```

The backup strategy includes:

1. **Regular Backups**:

   - Daily full database backups during low-traffic periods
   - Continuous Write-Ahead Log (WAL) archiving for point-in-time recovery
   - Weekly incremental backups to minimize storage requirements

2. **Storage and Retention**:

   - All backups stored in encrypted S3 buckets
   - 30-day retention for daily backups
   - 90-day retention for weekly backups
   - 1-year retention for monthly backups

3. **Verification Process**:

   - Weekly automated restore tests to verify backup integrity
   - Automated validation of restored data
   - Backup success/failure notifications to administrators

### 6.2.2 DATA MANAGEMENT

#### Migration Procedures

The database migration strategy follows these principles:

1. **Version-Controlled Migrations**:

   - All schema changes tracked in version control
   - Migrations implemented using Alembic with SQLAlchemy
   - Each migration includes both upgrade and downgrade paths

2. **Migration Process**:

   - Development migrations tested in staging environment
   - Production migrations scheduled during maintenance windows
   - Automated rollback procedures if migration fails

3. **Migration Types**:

   - Schema migrations (structure changes)
   - Data migrations (content transformations)
   - Index modifications (performance optimizations)

| Migration Type | Tool | Testing Approach | Rollback Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Schema Changes | Alembic | Staging environment validation | Automatic downgrade scripts |
| Data Transformations | Custom scripts + Alembic | Data integrity checks | Backup restoration if needed |
| Index Modifications | Alembic | Performance benchmarking | Revert to previous index configuration |

#### Versioning Strategy

The database versioning approach includes:

1. **Schema Versioning**:

   - Sequential version numbers for database schema
   - Version information stored in a dedicated database table
   - Application checks database version compatibility at startup

2. **Data Versioning**:

   - Timestamp-based versioning for critical data changes
   - Audit trails for significant data modifications
   - No hard deletion of critical data (soft delete with status flags)

#### Archival Policies

| Data Type | Active Retention | Archival Trigger | Archival Storage | Retrieval Process |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Documents | Indefinite | Manual deletion or 3 years of inactivity | Cold storage (S3 Glacier) | On-demand restoration process |
| Queries | 1 year | Age \> 1 year | Compressed archive tables | SQL query with archive flag |
| Feedback | 2 years | Age \> 2 years | Compressed archive tables | SQL query with archive flag |
| User Data | Until account deletion | Account inactive \> 2 years | Anonymized archive | Support request required |

#### Data Storage and Retrieval Mechanisms

The system employs a hybrid storage approach:

1. **Relational Data (PostgreSQL)**:

   - Document metadata
   - User information
   - Query history
   - Feedback data

2. **Vector Data (FAISS)**:

   - Document embeddings stored in FAISS indices
   - Query embeddings for similarity search
   - FAISS indices persisted to disk and memory-mapped for performance

3. **File Storage**:

   - Original PDF documents stored in file system or object storage
   - Path references maintained in PostgreSQL

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Upload[Document Upload] --> Extract[Text Extraction]
    Extract --> Chunk[Text Chunking]
    Chunk --> Embed[Generate Embeddings]

    RetrieveChunks --> PG
    RetrieveChunks --> GenerateResponse[Generate AI Response]
    
    GenerateResponse --> StoreQuery[Store Query & Response]
    StoreQuery --> PG
```

#### Caching Policies

| Cache Type | Implementation | Invalidation Strategy | Size Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Query Results | In-memory LRU cache | Time-based (30 minutes) + manual invalidation | 1GB memory limit |
| Document Metadata | Database query cache | Automatic on document update/delete | Default PostgreSQL settings |
| Vector Embeddings | Memory-mapped FAISS index | Manual rebuild on significant changes | Based on available system memory |
| Authentication Tokens | Redis cache | Time-based expiration (JWT expiry) | 100MB memory limit |

### 6.2.3 COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

#### Data Retention Rules

| Data Category | Retention Period | Justification | Deletion Process |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User Accounts | Until deletion request + 30 days | User control over personal data | Soft delete, then hard delete after 30 days |
| Documents | Until deletion request or 7 years | Business records retention | Soft delete with option for hard delete |
| Query History | 1 year active, 2 years archived | Balance between utility and storage | Automatic archival, then deletion |
| Feedback Data | 2 years active, 3 years archived | Reinforcement learning needs | Automatic archival, then deletion |
| Authentication Logs | 90 days | Security monitoring | Automatic deletion after retention period |

#### Backup and Fault Tolerance Policies

1. **Backup Schedule**:

   - Daily full backups (encrypted)
   - Continuous WAL archiving
   - Weekly backup verification

2. **Fault Tolerance**:

   - Primary-replica database configuration
   - Automatic failover to replica
   - Regular health checks and monitoring

3. **Recovery Objectives**:

   - Recovery Point Objective (RPO): \< 15 minutes
   - Recovery Time Objective (RTO): \< 1 hour

#### Privacy Controls

| Privacy Requirement | Implementation | Verification Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Minimization | Collect only necessary user data | Regular privacy audits |
| Access Controls | Role-based permissions | Permission matrix review |
| Data Encryption | Encryption at rest and in transit | Security scanning |
| User Consent | Clear terms of service and privacy policy | Legal review |
| Right to be Forgotten | Account deletion process | Process testing |

#### Audit Mechanisms

The system implements comprehensive auditing:

1. **Database-Level Auditing**:

   - PostgreSQL audit logging for sensitive operations
   - Tracking of all data modifications with user ID and timestamp
   - Separate audit log storage with restricted access

2. **Application-Level Auditing**:

   - Logging of all authentication attempts
   - Tracking of document access and modifications
   - Query history with user attribution

3. **Audit Log Protection**:

   - Immutable audit logs
   - Separate storage from application data
   - Restricted access to audit information

#### Access Controls

```mermaid
graph TD
    User[User] -->|Authenticate| Auth[Authentication Service]
    Auth -->|Validate| Token[JWT Token]
    
    subgraph "Database Access Control"
        Token -->|Authorize| RBAC[Role-Based Access Control]
        RBAC -->|Admin Role| AdminAccess[Full Access]
        RBAC -->|Regular Role| UserAccess[Limited Access]
        
        AdminAccess --> AllData[All Database Tables]
        UserAccess --> UserData[User's Own Data]
        UserAccess --> PublicData[Public Data]
    end
```

Database access controls include:

1. **User-Level Controls**:

   - Database roles aligned with application roles
   - Principle of least privilege for database access
   - Connection credentials managed through secure vault

2. **Row-Level Security**:

   - PostgreSQL row-level security policies
   - Users can only access their own data
   - Administrators have broader access with audit logging

3. **Column-Level Security**:

   - Sensitive data columns encrypted
   - Access to decryption keys restricted
   - Masking of sensitive data in query results for certain roles

### 6.2.4 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

#### Query Optimization Patterns

| Query Pattern | Optimization Technique | Expected Improvement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Document Listing | Covering indexes for common filters | 50-70% reduction in query time |
| User Authentication | Indexed username lookups | 90% reduction in auth query time |
| Vector ID Retrieval | Composite indexes for document chunks | 60% reduction in retrieval time |
| Feedback Aggregation | Materialized views for common aggregations | 80% reduction in aggregation time |

Key query optimization strategies include:

1. **Index Optimization**:

   - Strategic index creation based on query patterns
   - Regular index maintenance and rebuilding
   - Monitoring of index usage and performance

2. **Query Tuning**:

   - Prepared statements for all database operations
   - Optimized JOIN operations with proper conditions
   - Limiting result sets with pagination

3. **Schema Optimization**:

   - Normalization for data integrity
   - Strategic denormalization for query performance
   - Appropriate data types for storage efficiency

#### Caching Strategy

The system implements a multi-level caching strategy:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[Client] --> APICache[API Response Cache]

#### Connection Pooling

| Pool Type | Min Connections | Max Connections | Idle Timeout | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Application Pool | 5 | 20 | 10 minutes | SQLAlchemy connection pool |
| Read Replica Pool | 3 | 15 | 5 minutes | PgBouncer |
| Admin Connection Pool | 2 | 5 | 30 minutes | SQLAlchemy connection pool |

Connection pooling configuration:

1. **Pool Sizing**:

   - Minimum connections maintained for responsiveness
   - Maximum connections limited to prevent database overload
   - Connection creation/destruction metrics monitored

2. **Connection Lifecycle**:

   - Connections validated before use
   - Idle connections recycled after timeout
   - Connection errors handled with retry logic

3. **Pool Segregation**:

   - Separate pools for read and write operations
   - Dedicated pools for background tasks
   - Isolated pools for administrative functions

#### Read/Write Splitting

The system implements read/write splitting to optimize database performance:

1. **Write Operations**:

   - All writes directed to primary database
   - Transactional integrity maintained
   - Write operations batched where possible

2. **Read Operations**:

   - Distributed across read replicas
   - Load balancing based on replica load
   - Stale read tolerance configurable by operation

3. **Consistency Management**:

   - Session consistency for user operations
   - Replica lag monitoring
   - Fallback to primary for critical reads

#### Batch Processing Approach

| Operation | Batch Size | Processing Frequency | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Document Indexing | 100 chunks | Real-time | Background task queue |
| Vector Generation | 50 documents | Real-time | Parallel processing |
| Query Archiving | 1000 queries | Daily | Scheduled job |
| Feedback Processing | All feedback | Weekly | Reinforcement learning job |

Batch processing strategies:

1. **Document Processing**:

   - Chunking and embedding generation in batches
   - Parallel processing of multiple documents
   - Progress tracking and resumability

2. **Database Operations**:

   - Bulk inserts for efficiency
   - Transaction management for consistency
   - Error handling with partial success capability

3. **Maintenance Operations**:

   - Scheduled during low-traffic periods
   - Incremental processing to minimize impact
   - Monitoring and alerting on batch job status

## 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### 6.3.1 API DESIGN

The Document Management and AI Chatbot System exposes a comprehensive REST API that serves as the primary integration point for client applications. The API is designed with consistency, security, and performance in mind.

#### Protocol Specifications

| Aspect | Specification | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol | HTTPS | All API communications use TLS 1.2+ |
| Format | JSON | Request and response bodies use JSON format |
| HTTP Methods | GET, POST, DELETE | Standard HTTP methods for CRUD operations |
| Status Codes | Standard HTTP | 2xx for success, 4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors |

#### Authentication Methods

The system implements JWT-based authentication for securing API access:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Auth as Authentication Endpoint
    participant API as Protected API Endpoints
    
    Client->>Auth: POST /auth/token (credentials)
    Auth->>Auth: Validate credentials
    Auth-->>Client: JWT Access Token + Refresh Token
    
    Client->>API: Request with Bearer Token
    API->>API: Validate JWT
    API-->>Client: Protected Resource
    
    Note over Client,API: Token Refresh Flow
    Client->>Auth: POST /auth/refresh (refresh_token)
    Auth->>Auth: Validate refresh token
    Auth-->>Client: New JWT Access Token
```

| Authentication Aspect | Implementation | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Token Format | JWT | Contains user ID, role, and expiration |
| Token Lifetime | 1 hour | Short-lived access tokens |
| Refresh Mechanism | Refresh Tokens | 7-day validity for extended sessions |
| Token Storage | HTTP-only Cookies | For web clients (optional Bearer token for other clients) |

#### Authorization Framework

The system implements role-based access control (RBAC) with the following roles:

| Role | Access Level | Permissions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin | Full access | All operations including user management |
| Regular User | Limited access | Document upload, search, and feedback |
| Guest | Minimal access | Limited search functionality only |

Authorization is implemented using FastAPI's dependency injection system:

```python
# Pseudocode for authorization implementation
def require_role(allowed_roles: List[str]):
    def dependency(token: str = Depends(get_token)):
        payload = decode_jwt(token)
        if payload["role"] not in allowed_roles:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Permission denied")
        return payload
    return dependency

# Usage example
@app.post("/documents/upload")
async def upload_document(
    file: UploadFile,
    user: dict = Depends(require_role(["admin", "regular"]))
):
    # Implementation
```

#### Rate Limiting Strategy

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource allocation:

| Client Type | Rate Limit | Timeframe | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anonymous | 10 requests | Per minute | IP-based limiting |
| Authenticated | 60 requests | Per minute | User-based limiting |
| Admin | 120 requests | Per minute | Role-based limiting |

Rate limiting is implemented using Redis for token bucket algorithm:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[API Request] --> B{Check Rate Limit}
    B -->|Limit Exceeded| C[Return 429 Too Many Requests]
    B -->|Limit OK| D[Process Request]
    D --> E[Return Response]
    D --> F[Update Rate Limit Counter]
    F --> G[Store in Redis]
```

#### Versioning Approach

The API uses URI-based versioning to support multiple API versions:

| Version | URI Format | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v1 | /api/v1/resource | Current stable version |
| v2 | /api/v2/resource | In development |

Version compatibility is maintained through:

- Backward compatibility within major versions
- Deprecation notices for endpoints scheduled for removal
- Minimum 6-month support for deprecated endpoints

#### Documentation Standards

The API is documented using OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications:

| Documentation Aspect | Implementation | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API Specification | OpenAPI 3.0 | Generated automatically by FastAPI |
| Interactive Documentation | Swagger UI | Available at /docs endpoint |
| Alternative Documentation | ReDoc | Available at /redoc endpoint |
| Code Examples | Multiple languages | Python, JavaScript, curl examples |

### 6.3.2 MESSAGE PROCESSING

#### Event Processing Patterns

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Document Upload] --> B[Document Processing Queue]
    B --> C{Process Document}
    C -->|Success| D[Store in Vector DB]
    C -->|Failure| E[Error Queue]
    E --> F[Retry Processing]
    F --> C
    
    G[User Query] --> H[Query Processing]
    H --> I[Vector Search]
    I --> J[LLM Response Generation]
    J --> K[Store Results]
    
    L[User Feedback] --> M[Feedback Collection]
    M --> N[Feedback Storage]
    N --> O[Periodic RL Processing]
```

The system uses the following event processing patterns:

1. **Command Pattern**: For document upload and processing
2. **Query Pattern**: For search and retrieval operations
3. **Event Notification**: For system events like document processing completion

#### Message Queue Architecture

For asynchronous processing, the system uses background tasks with FastAPI:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API as FastAPI Endpoint
    participant BG as Background Tasks
    participant DB as Database
    participant FAISS as Vector Store
    
    Client->>API: Upload Document
    API->>Client: 202 Accepted (Processing Started)
    API->>BG: Add Background Task
    BG->>BG: Process Document
    BG->>DB: Update Document Status (Processing)
    BG->>BG: Extract Text
    BG->>BG: Generate Embeddings
    BG->>FAISS: Store Embeddings
    BG->>DB: Update Document Status (Complete)
```

| Queue Type | Purpose | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Document Processing | Handle document uploads asynchronously | FastAPI BackgroundTasks |
| Vector Generation | Generate embeddings for document chunks | FastAPI BackgroundTasks |
| Feedback Processing | Aggregate feedback for RL | Scheduled tasks |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[User Feedback] --> B[Feedback Collector]
    B --> C[Feedback Store]
    C --> D[Feedback Aggregator]
    D --> E[RL Model Updater]
    E --> F[Updated Response Generation]
```

Stream processing is primarily used for:

- Real-time feedback collection
- Monitoring system performance
- Event logging for audit purposes

#### Batch Processing Flows

The system implements batch processing for computationally intensive operations:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Scheduled Trigger] --> B[Retrieve Pending Documents]
    B --> C[Batch Process Documents]
    C --> D[Store Results]
    
    E[Scheduled Trigger] --> F[Retrieve Accumulated Feedback]
    F --> G[Process Feedback Batch]
    G --> H[Update RL Model]
```

| Batch Process | Frequency | Batch Size | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Document Indexing | Real-time | 10 documents | Background tasks |
| Vector Reindexing | Weekly | All documents | Scheduled job |
| Feedback Processing | Daily | All feedback | Scheduled job |

#### Error Handling Strategy

The system implements a comprehensive error handling strategy for message processing:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Message Processing] --> B{Success?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Normal Processing]
    B -->|No| D{Retryable Error?}
    
    D -->|Yes| E[Add to Retry Queue]
    E --> F[Apply Backoff]
    F --> G[Retry Processing]
    G --> B
    
    D -->|No| H[Dead Letter Queue]
    H --> I[Alert Administrator]
    H --> J[Manual Resolution]
```

Error handling includes:

- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queues for failed messages
- Comprehensive error logging
- Alerting for critical failures

### 6.3.3 EXTERNAL SYSTEMS

## 6.4 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

The Document Management and AI Chatbot System requires a comprehensive security architecture to protect sensitive document data, user information, and system integrity. This section outlines the security controls, mechanisms, and policies implemented throughout the system.

### 6.4.1 AUTHENTICATION FRAMEWORK

The system implements a robust authentication framework based on JWT tokens to secure API access and verify user identity.

#### Identity Management

| Component | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User Registration | Email/password with validation | Create new user accounts with verified identity |
| User Repository | PostgreSQL with encrypted passwords | Secure storage of user credentials |
| Identity Verification | Email verification flow | Ensure valid user email addresses |
| Account Recovery | Secure password reset flow | Allow users to recover access safely |

#### Token-Based Authentication

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API as API Gateway
    participant Auth as Authentication Service
    participant DB as User Database
    
    User->>API: Login Request (username/password)
    API->>Auth: Forward credentials
    Auth->>DB: Verify credentials
    DB-->>Auth: Validation result
    
    alt Valid Credentials
        Auth->>Auth: Generate JWT token
        Auth->>Auth: Generate refresh token
        Auth->>DB: Store refresh token
        Auth-->>API: Return tokens
        API-->>User: Authentication successful (JWT + refresh token)
    else Invalid Credentials
        Auth-->>API: Authentication failed
        API-->>User: 401 Unauthorized
    end
    
    Note over User,API: Subsequent API Requests
    User->>API: API Request with JWT
    API->>Auth: Validate token
    Auth-->>API: Token validation result
    
    alt Valid Token
        API->>API: Process request
        API-->>User: Response
    else Invalid Token
        API-->>User: 401 Unauthorized
    end
```

#### Session Management

| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum Length | 10 characters | Validated during registration and changes |
| Complexity | Must include uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol | Regex validation with feedback |
| History | No reuse of last 5 passwords | Store password history hashes |
| Expiration | 90 days | Prompt for change on expiration |
| Failed Attempts | Account lockout after 5 failed attempts | Temporary lockout with increasing duration |

### 6.4.2 AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM

The system implements a role-based access control (RBAC) model to ensure users can only access resources and perform actions appropriate to their role.

#### Role-Based Access Control

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    User[User Request] --> Auth[Authentication]
    Auth --> RBAC[Role Check]
    
    RBAC --> Admin{Admin?}
    RBAC --> Regular{Regular User?}
    RBAC --> Guest{Guest?}
    
    Admin -->|Yes| AdminRes[Full System Access]
    Regular -->|Yes| RegularRes[Document Upload/Search]
    Guest -->|Yes| GuestRes[Limited Search Only]
    
    Admin -->|No| Regular
    Regular -->|No| Guest
    Guest -->|No| Denied[Access Denied]
```

#### Permission Matrix

| Resource | Admin | Regular User | Guest |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Document Upload | Create, Read, Update, Delete | Create, Read, Update (own) | None |
| Document Search | Full access | Full access | Limited queries |
| User Management | Full access | None | None |
| Feedback | View all, Process | Submit, View own | None |
| System Settings | Full access | None | None |

#### Resource Authorization

The system implements resource-level authorization to ensure users can only access their own resources or resources explicitly shared with them:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API as API Gateway
    participant Auth as Authorization Service
    participant Resource as Resource Manager
    
    User->>API: Request Resource Access
    API->>Auth: Check Authorization
    Auth->>Auth: Verify User Role
    Auth->>Resource: Check Resource Ownership
    
    alt User Owns Resource or Has Permission
        Resource-->>Auth: Access Granted
        Auth-->>API: Authorization Successful
        API->>Resource: Process Resource Request
        Resource-->>API: Resource Data
        API-->>User: Resource Response
    else No Permission
        Resource-->>Auth: Access Denied
        Auth-->>API: Authorization Failed
        API-->>User: 403 Forbidden
    end
```

#### Policy Enforcement Points

| Enforcement Point | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API Gateway | Request interceptor | Validate JWT and extract user role |
| Service Layer | Method-level annotations | Check permissions before processing |
| Data Access Layer | Row-level security | Enforce data access restrictions |
| Frontend | UI element visibility | Hide unauthorized functionality |

#### Audit Logging

The system maintains comprehensive audit logs for security-relevant events:

| Event Type | Information Logged | Retention Period |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication | User ID, timestamp, IP address, success/failure | 90 days |
| Authorization | User ID, resource, action, timestamp, success/failure | 90 days |
| Document Access | User ID, document ID, action, timestamp | 1 year |
| Admin Actions | User ID, action, affected resource, timestamp | 1 year |

### 6.4.3 DATA PROTECTION

The system implements multiple layers of data protection to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information.

#### Encryption Standards

| Data Type | Encryption Method | Key Strength |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data at Rest | AES-256 | 256-bit keys |
| Data in Transit | TLS 1.3 | ECDHE with P-256 |
| Passwords | Argon2id | Memory: 65536 KB, Iterations: 3, Parallelism: 4 |
| Document Content | AES-256-GCM | 256-bit keys with unique IV per document |

#### Key Management

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Key Hierarchy"
        MK[Master Key] --> DEK1[Document Encryption Key 1]
        MK --> DEK2[Document Encryption Key 2]
        MK --> DEK3[Document Encryption Key 3]
        MK --> TEK[Token Encryption Key]
    end
    
    subgraph "Key Storage"
        MK --> KMS[Key Management Service]
        DEK1 --> DB[(Encrypted in Database)]
        DEK2 --> DB
        DEK3 --> DB
        TEK --> MS[Memory Store]
    end
    
    subgraph "Key Rotation"
        KR[Key Rotation Service] --> MK
        KR --> DEK1
        KR --> DEK2
        KR --> DEK3
        KR --> TEK
    end
```

Key management practices include:

- Encryption keys stored in a secure key management service
- Automatic key rotation every 90 days
- Key access limited to authorized services only
- Key backup and recovery procedures

#### Data Masking Rules

### 6.6.8 RISK MITIGATION

| Risk Area | Testing Approach | Mitigation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LLM Integration | Robust mocking and contract testing | Fallback mechanisms for service unavailability |
| Vector Search Accuracy | Relevance testing with known datasets | Regular index quality evaluation |
| Performance Degradation | Regular performance testing | Performance budgets and alerts |
| Security Vulnerabilities | Comprehensive security testing | Regular dependency updates |

**Contingency Planning:**

1. Test environment unavailability

   - Maintain backup environments
   - Ability to run critical tests locally

2. External service dependencies

   - Comprehensive mocking capabilities
   - Service simulators for testing

3. Test data corruption

   - Versioned test fixtures
   - Automated data validation

## 7. USER INTERFACE DESIGN

No user interface required. This project is a backend API system only.

The Document Management and AI Chatbot System is designed as a backend solution that exposes RESTful APIs for document management, vector search, and AI-powered responses. Client applications would need to implement their own user interfaces to interact with these APIs.

For frontend development guidance, the following API endpoints would need to be integrated:

1. Document Management API endpoints:

   - POST /documents/upload
   - GET /documents/list
   - DELETE /documents/{document_id}
   - GET /documents/{document_id}

2. Vector Search API endpoints:

   - POST /query
   - GET /query/{query_id}

3. Reinforcement Learning API endpoints:

   - POST /feedback
   - GET /feedback/{query_id}
   - POST /reinforce

4. Authentication endpoints:

   - POST /auth/token
   - POST /auth/refresh

Any frontend implementation would need to handle authentication, document upload, search functionality, and feedback collection while communicating with these backend APIs.

## 8. INFRASTRUCTURE

    B --> C[Application Code Layer]
    C --> D[Configuration Layer]
    D --> E[Final Image]
```

| Layer | Content | Update Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base Image | Python 3.10-slim | Security updates only |
| Dependencies | Core libraries and packages | When dependencies change |
| Application | Application code | Every deployment |
| Configuration | Environment-specific configs | Per environment |

**Security Considerations:**

- Use minimal base images to reduce attack surface
- Implement multi-stage builds to minimize final image size
- Run containers as non-root users
