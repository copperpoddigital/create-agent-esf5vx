# Searching Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides detailed instructions for using the search functionality in the Document Management and AI Chatbot System. The system combines vector-based document search with AI-powered responses to provide intelligent answers to your questions based on the content of your document collection.

The search functionality is powered by vector similarity search, which enables semantic understanding of your queries beyond simple keyword matching. This means the system can find relevant documents even when they don't contain the exact words from your query, as long as they are conceptually related.

This guide will help you understand how to formulate effective queries, interpret search results, and optimize your search experience.

## Search Capabilities

The system offers the following search capabilities:

- **Semantic Search**: Find documents based on meaning, not just keywords
- **AI-Generated Responses**: Receive contextual answers based on document content
- **Document References**: See which documents were used to generate responses
- **Relevance Scoring**: Understand how closely documents match your query
- **Search History**: Access your previous queries and responses

These capabilities enable a more natural and effective way to find information in your document collection compared to traditional keyword search.

# Understanding Vector Search

## Vector Search Basics

Vector search is the core technology that powers the system's search functionality. Here's how it works:

1. **Document Processing**: When documents are uploaded to the system, they are processed into chunks, and each chunk is converted into a vector embedding (a list of numbers) that represents its semantic meaning.

2. **Vector Database**: These vector embeddings are stored in FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), a specialized database optimized for similarity search.

3. **Query Processing**: When you submit a search query, it's also converted into a vector embedding using the same process.

4. **Similarity Matching**: The system finds document chunks with vector embeddings most similar to your query vector, using a mathematical measure called cosine similarity.

5. **Response Generation**: The most relevant document chunks are used as context for an AI language model to generate a comprehensive response to your query.

This approach allows the system to understand the meaning behind your questions and find relevant information even when the exact wording differs between your query and the documents.

## Advantages Over Traditional Search

Vector search offers several advantages over traditional keyword-based search:

- **Semantic Understanding**: Finds conceptually related content, not just exact keyword matches
- **Natural Language Queries**: Supports questions in natural language rather than keyword combinations
- **Contextual Relevance**: Considers the context and meaning of words, not just their presence
- **Handling Synonyms**: Recognizes different terms with similar meanings
- **Cross-Lingual Potential**: Can potentially find relevant content across different languages (in future versions)

These advantages make vector search particularly effective for knowledge discovery and question answering in document collections.

## Limitations to Be Aware Of

While vector search is powerful, it's important to understand its limitations:

- **Not Perfect for Exact Matches**: Traditional search might be better when you need exact phrase matching
- **Dependent on Document Quality**: Search quality depends on the quality of your document collection
- **Context Window Limitations**: The system can only consider a limited amount of text when generating responses
- **Potential for Hallucinations**: AI-generated responses might occasionally include inaccurate information not found in the documents
- **Semantic Drift**: Very long or ambiguous queries might lead to unexpected results

Being aware of these limitations will help you formulate more effective queries and better interpret the results.

# Formulating Effective Queries

## Query Structure Best Practices

To get the most relevant results, consider these best practices for structuring your queries:

- **Be Specific**: Clearly state what you're looking for
- **Use Natural Language**: Phrase queries as questions or complete sentences
- **Include Context**: Provide relevant background information when needed
- **Focus on One Topic**: Ask about one specific topic per query
- **Avoid Overly Complex Queries**: Break complex questions into simpler ones
- **Keep a Reasonable Length**: Aim for queries between 5 and 50 words

Example of an effective query:
"What are the key advantages of vector databases compared to traditional databases for semantic search?"

This query is specific, uses natural language, focuses on one topic, and has a reasonable length.

## Query Examples

Here are examples of effective queries and how to improve less effective ones:

**Effective Queries:**
- "How does FAISS handle similarity search for large vector collections?"
- "What are the best practices for document chunking in vector search systems?"
- "Explain the process of generating vector embeddings from text documents."

**Less Effective Queries and Improvements:**

| Less Effective Query | Improved Query | Reason for Improvement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "vector" | "What are vector embeddings and how are they used in search?" | Too vague → Specific question |
| "Tell me everything about FAISS, vector databases, embeddings, and similarity search" | "What is FAISS and how does it compare to other vector databases?" | Too broad → Focused question |
| "docs pdf search" | "How does the system search through PDF documents?" | Keywords only → Natural language |

By following these examples, you can craft queries that are more likely to yield relevant results.

## Query Parameters

When submitting a query, you can include optional parameters to customize the search behavior:

- **max_results**: Maximum number of relevant documents to return (default: 5)
- **similarity_threshold**: Minimum similarity score for included documents (default: 0.7)

Example query with parameters:
```json
{
  "query_text": "How does vector similarity search work?",
  "max_results": 3,
  "similarity_threshold": 0.8
}
```

Adjusting these parameters can help you fine-tune your search results:

- Increase `max_results` when you want more comprehensive context
- Increase `similarity_threshold` when you want only highly relevant documents
- Decrease `similarity_threshold` when you're not getting enough results

Experiment with these parameters to find the optimal settings for your specific use case.

# Submitting Search Queries

## Authentication Options

The search API supports both authenticated and anonymous queries:

- **Authenticated Queries**: Include a JWT token in the Authorization header
- **Anonymous Queries**: Submit without authentication

Authenticated queries offer several advantages:
- Your queries and responses are stored for future reference
- You can access your search history
- You can provide feedback on responses
- You may have higher rate limits

For most use cases, authenticated queries are recommended. See the [API Integration Guide](./api-integration.md) for details on authentication.

## Basic Query Submission

To submit a basic search query, make a POST request to the query endpoint:

```
POST /api/v1/query/
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token} (optional)

{
  "query_text": "How does vector similarity search work?"
}
```

Example using curl:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.example.com/api/v1/query/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
  -d '{"query_text": "How does vector similarity search work?"}'
```

Example using JavaScript:
```javascript
async function submitQuery(queryText, accessToken = null) {
  const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  };
  
  if (accessToken) {
    headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${accessToken}`;
  }
  
  const response = await fetch('/api/v1/query/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: headers,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query_text: queryText
    })
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Query submission failed: ${response.status}`);
  }

  return await response.json();
}
```

The system will process your query and return a response with an AI-generated answer and relevant document references.

## Advanced Query Options

For more control over search results, you can include additional parameters in your query:

```json
{
  "query_text": "How does vector similarity search work?",
  "max_results": 5,
  "similarity_threshold": 0.7
}
```

Example using JavaScript with advanced options:
```javascript
async function submitAdvancedQuery(queryText, maxResults = 5, similarityThreshold = 0.7, accessToken = null) {
  const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  };
  
  if (accessToken) {
    headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${accessToken}`;
  }
  
  const response = await fetch('/api/v1/query/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: headers,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query_text: queryText,
      max_results: maxResults,
      similarity_threshold: similarityThreshold
    })
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Query submission failed: ${response.status}`);
  }

  return await response.json();
}
```

These parameters allow you to customize the search behavior to better suit your specific needs.

## Rate Limits and Performance

Be aware of the following performance considerations when submitting queries:

- **Response Time**: Typical queries are processed within 3 seconds
- **Rate Limits**: 
  - Anonymous users: 10 queries per minute
  - Authenticated users: 60 queries per minute
  - Admin users: 120 queries per minute
- **Query Length**: Queries are limited to 1000 characters maximum

If you exceed rate limits, the API will return a 429 Too Many Requests response with a Retry-After header indicating when you can retry the request.

For optimal performance, avoid submitting multiple queries in rapid succession and consider implementing client-side caching for frequently used queries.

# Understanding Search Results

## Response Structure

When you submit a query, the system returns a response with the following structure:

```json
{
  "query_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "query_text": "How does vector similarity search work?",
  "response_text": "Vector similarity search works by converting text into numerical vector representations (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning. These vectors are stored in a specialized database like FAISS. When a query is submitted, it's also converted to a vector, and the system finds documents with vectors most similar to the query vector using distance metrics like cosine similarity. This approach enables semantic search beyond simple keyword matching, finding documents that are conceptually related even if they don't share exact terms.",
  "relevant_documents": [
    {
      "document_id": "abc12345-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
      "content": "Vector similarity search is a technique used to find documents or text chunks that are semantically similar to a query. It works by converting text into high-dimensional vector embeddings using models like Sentence Transformers, then using efficient algorithms to find vectors that are close to each other in the vector space.",
      "similarity_score": 0.92
    },
    {
      "document_id": "def67890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
      "content": "FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library that enables efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size, up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM.",
      "similarity_score": 0.85
    }
  ]
}
```

Key components of the response:

- **query_id**: Unique identifier for the query (useful for retrieving it later)
- **query_text**: The original query text you submitted
- **response_text**: AI-generated answer based on relevant documents
- **relevant_documents**: List of document chunks used to generate the response, with similarity scores

## Interpreting Similarity Scores

Each document in the search results includes a similarity score that indicates how closely it matches your query:

- **0.9 - 1.0**: Extremely high relevance, very closely related to the query
- **0.8 - 0.9**: High relevance, strongly related to the query
- **0.7 - 0.8**: Good relevance, clearly related to the query
- **0.6 - 0.7**: Moderate relevance, somewhat related to the query
- **Below 0.6**: Lower relevance, may be tangentially related to the query

By default, the system only includes documents with a similarity score of 0.7 or higher in the results. You can adjust this threshold using the `similarity_threshold` parameter.

The similarity score is based on cosine similarity between vector embeddings, which measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. A score of 1.0 means the vectors are identical (perfect match), while a score of 0.0 means they are completely unrelated.

## Evaluating Response Quality

When evaluating the quality of search responses, consider the following factors:

1. **Relevance**: Does the response directly address your query?
2. **Accuracy**: Is the information in the response correct and supported by the documents?
3. **Completeness**: Does the response cover all important aspects of your query?
4. **Coherence**: Is the response well-structured and easy to understand?
5. **Source Quality**: Are the referenced documents reliable and up-to-date?

If a response doesn't meet your expectations, you can:

- Refine your query to be more specific
- Adjust search parameters (max_results, similarity_threshold)
- Check if relevant documents exist in the system
- Provide feedback to help improve future responses

Remember that the quality of responses depends on the quality and coverage of your document collection. If important information is missing from your documents, the system won't be able to include it in responses.

## No Results Scenario

If the system doesn't find any documents that match your query with the specified similarity threshold, you'll receive a response indicating that no relevant information was found:

```json
{
  "query_id": "789e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "query_text": "What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?",
  "response_text": "I don't have enough information to answer this question. The documents in the system don't contain relevant information about the airspeed velocity of unladen swallows.",
  "relevant_documents": []
}
```

If you receive this response, consider:

- Rephrasing your query using different terminology
- Lowering the similarity threshold to include more documents
- Checking if documents containing the relevant information have been uploaded
- Broadening your query to a more general topic

The system is designed to acknowledge when it doesn't have enough information rather than providing speculative or incorrect answers.

# Managing Search History

## Retrieving Previous Queries

If you're using authenticated queries, the system stores your search history, allowing you to retrieve previous queries and responses. To access a specific query by ID:

```
GET /api/v1/query/{query_id}
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}
```

Example using curl:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/api/v1/query/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

Example using JavaScript:
```javascript
async function getQuery(queryId, accessToken) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/query/${queryId}`, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    }
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to retrieve query: ${response.status}`);
  }

  return await response.json();
}
```

This will return the query details including the original query text, response, and timestamp.

## Listing Your Query History

To retrieve a list of your previous queries with pagination:

```
GET /api/v1/query/me?skip=0&limit=10
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}
```

Example using curl:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/api/v1/query/me?limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

Example using JavaScript:
```javascript
async function listQueries(accessToken, skip = 0, limit = 10) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/query/me?skip=${skip}&limit=${limit}`, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    }
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to list queries: ${response.status}`);
  }

  return await response.json();
}
```

The response will include a list of your queries with basic information. You can then retrieve full details for any specific query using its ID.

## Searching Your Query History

To search within your query history for specific terms:

```
GET /api/v1/query/?search_term=vector&skip=0&limit=10
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}
```

Example using curl:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/api/v1/query/?search_term=vector&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

Example using JavaScript:
```javascript
async function searchQueries(searchTerm, accessToken, skip = 0, limit = 10) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/v1/query/?search_term=${encodeURIComponent(searchTerm)}&skip=${skip}&limit=${limit}`, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    }
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to search queries: ${response.status}`);
  }

  return await response.json();
}
```

This allows you to find previous queries related to specific topics, which can be useful for building on previous research or avoiding duplicate queries.

## Query History Limitations

Be aware of the following limitations regarding query history:

- **Anonymous Queries**: Not stored in history (require authentication)
- **Storage Duration**: Queries are stored for 1 year by default
- **Access Control**: You can only access your own queries (unless you're an admin)
- **Modification**: Query history is read-only and cannot be modified

If you need to preserve important query results for longer periods, consider saving them to your own storage system.

# Providing Feedback

## Feedback Importance

Providing feedback on search results is valuable for several reasons:

- It helps improve the system's response quality over time
- It identifies areas where document coverage could be improved
- It highlights queries that may need refinement
- It contributes to the reinforcement learning process

The system uses feedback to learn which responses are most helpful and to adjust its response generation accordingly. Your feedback directly contributes to system improvement.

## Submitting Feedback

To submit feedback on a query response, make a POST request to the feedback endpoint:

```
POST /api/v1/feedback/
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}

{
  "query_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "rating": 4,
  "comments": "Good response, but could include more specific examples."
}
```

Example using curl:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.example.com/api/v1/feedback/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
  -d '{"query_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000", "rating": 4, "comments": "Good response, but could include more specific examples."}'
```

Example using JavaScript:
```javascript
async function submitFeedback(queryId, rating, comments, accessToken) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/v1/feedback/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query_id: queryId,
      rating: rating,
      comments: comments
    })
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Feedback submission failed: ${response.status}`);
  }

  return await response.json();
}
```

The rating should be an integer from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest quality. Comments are optional but highly encouraged, especially for ratings below 4.

## Effective Feedback Guidelines

To provide the most helpful feedback:

- **Be Specific**: Explain what aspects of the response were helpful or unhelpful
- **Suggest Improvements**: Indicate how the response could be better
- **Note Missing Information**: Mention if important information was omitted
- **Highlight Inaccuracies**: Point out any incorrect information in the response
- **Provide Context**: Explain why the response did or didn't meet your needs

Example of helpful feedback:
"The response accurately explained vector similarity search but didn't mention the performance trade-offs between different index types in FAISS. Including information about IVF vs. HNSW indexes would make it more complete."

For more detailed guidance on providing feedback, see the [Feedback Guide](./feedback.md).

# Advanced Search Techniques

## Iterative Refinement

One effective search strategy is iterative refinement, where you start with a broader query and progressively narrow it down based on the results:

1. **Start Broad**: Begin with a general query about your topic
2. **Analyze Results**: Review the initial response and relevant documents
3. **Refine Query**: Create a more specific follow-up query based on the initial results
4. **Repeat**: Continue refining until you find the exact information you need

Example iterative refinement:

Initial query: "What is FAISS?"
Follow-up: "How does FAISS handle billion-scale vector collections?"
Final query: "What are the memory requirements for using FAISS with 1 billion vectors?"

This approach helps you navigate complex topics and discover information you might not have known to ask for directly.

## Comparative Queries

Comparative queries can be particularly effective for understanding relationships between concepts:

- "What are the differences between FAISS and Elasticsearch for vector search?"
- "Compare and contrast vector databases and traditional relational databases."
- "What are the advantages and disadvantages of different chunking strategies?"

These queries prompt the system to synthesize information from multiple documents and present a balanced comparison, which can be more insightful than querying about each concept separately.

## Targeted Document Queries

If you're interested in information from specific documents, you can include identifying information in your query:

- "What does the FAISS documentation say about IVF indexes?"
- "Summarize the key points from the document about vector database performance."
- "Find information about token limits in the LLM integration guide."

While the system doesn't support direct document filtering in queries, including document-specific terminology or titles can help bias the search toward relevant documents.

## Multi-Turn Conversations

Although the current system doesn't maintain conversation state between queries, you can simulate a conversation by referencing previous queries and including context:

1. Initial query: "What are vector embeddings?"
2. Follow-up: "Based on the previous explanation of vector embeddings, how are they generated from text?"
3. Next follow-up: "Continuing our discussion on vector embeddings, what models are commonly used to create them?"

By explicitly referencing the context of your previous queries, you can build on earlier responses and create a more coherent learning experience.

# Troubleshooting

## Irrelevant Search Results

If you're getting irrelevant search results, try these solutions:

- **Be More Specific**: Make your query more detailed and focused
- **Use Different Terminology**: Try alternative terms or phrasings
- **Increase Similarity Threshold**: Set a higher threshold (e.g., 0.8) to get only highly relevant results
- **Check Document Coverage**: Verify that relevant documents exist in the system
- **Review Document Quality**: Check if documents have been properly processed

Example of refining a query:
Original: "Tell me about vectors"
Improved: "Explain how vector embeddings represent semantic meaning in NLP applications"

## No Results Found

If the system returns no results for your query, consider these approaches:

- **Broaden Your Query**: Make your query more general
- **Lower Similarity Threshold**: Try a lower threshold (e.g., 0.6) to include more documents
- **Check Alternative Terminology**: Use different terms that might appear in the documents
- **Verify Document Existence**: Confirm that documents on the topic have been uploaded
- **Check Document Status**: Ensure relevant documents are in 'available' status

Example of broadening a query:
Original: "What is the optimal IVF nlist parameter for FAISS with 10 million vectors?"
Broadened: "How should FAISS parameters be configured for large vector collections?"

## Incomplete or Inaccurate Responses

If responses are incomplete or contain inaccuracies:

- **Request More Context**: Increase the max_results parameter to include more document chunks
- **Check Source Documents**: Review the referenced documents to verify information
- **Provide Feedback**: Submit detailed feedback about the issues
- **Refine Your Query**: Make your query more precise to focus on specific aspects
- **Consider Document Updates**: You may need to upload additional or updated documents

Remember that the system can only provide information based on the documents it has access to. If critical information is missing from your document collection, consider uploading additional relevant documents.

## API Errors

Common API errors and their solutions:

| Error Code | Description | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 Bad Request | Invalid query parameters | Check query format and parameters |
| 401 Unauthorized | Authentication required | Refresh your authentication token |
| 403 Forbidden | Permission denied | Verify you have access to the requested resource |
| 404 Not Found | Resource not found | Check that the query ID exists |
| 422 Unprocessable Entity | Query validation failed | Ensure query meets length and format requirements |
| 429 Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded | Reduce query frequency or implement backoff |

For persistent API issues, check your network connection and verify that the API service is operational.

# Best Practices

## Document Preparation

The quality of search results depends significantly on your document collection:

- **Upload Comprehensive Documents**: Ensure your document collection covers all relevant topics
- **Maintain Document Quality**: Use well-structured, clearly written documents
- **Update Regularly**: Replace outdated documents with current information
- **Consider Granularity**: Sometimes multiple focused documents work better than one large document
- **Check Processing Status**: Verify that documents are successfully processed
- **Optimize PDF Quality**: Use text-based PDFs rather than scanned images when possible
- **Use Descriptive Filenames**: Give documents clear names that reflect their content
- **Include Metadata**: Add appropriate titles and descriptions to your documents
- **Organize Content Logically**: Structure documents with clear headings and sections
- **Verify Text Extraction**: Ensure the system can properly extract text from your documents

Properly prepared documents lead to more accurate vector embeddings and better search results.

## Query Formulation

Effective query formulation is key to getting good results:

- **Be Clear and Specific**: Clearly state what you're looking for
- **Use Complete Sentences**: Phrase queries as questions or statements
- **Include Relevant Context**: Provide background information when needed
- **Avoid Ambiguity**: Use precise terminology to avoid confusion
- **Consider Length**: Aim for queries between 5 and 50 words

Remember that the system understands natural language, so you don't need to formulate queries as keywords or use special syntax.

## Search Workflow Integration

To integrate search effectively into your workflow:

- **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with general queries and refine based on results
- **Save Important Queries**: Keep track of useful queries and their IDs
- **Provide Regular Feedback**: Help improve the system by rating responses
- **Combine with Traditional Research**: Use the system alongside other research methods
- **Document Your Findings**: Save valuable responses for future reference

Consider developing a systematic approach to searching that fits your specific use case and information needs.

## Performance Optimization

To optimize system performance and your search experience:

- **Cache Common Queries**: Store frequently used queries and responses
- **Batch Processing**: Group related queries rather than rapid-fire individual queries
- **Schedule Intensive Searches**: Conduct intensive search sessions during off-peak hours
- **Monitor Rate Limits**: Be aware of your query frequency to avoid rate limiting
- **Implement Client-Side Caching**: Cache responses for frequently accessed information

These practices help maintain optimal system performance while maximizing the value you get from the search functionality.
