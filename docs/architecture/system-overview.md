## 2. Architectural Principles

The architecture of the Document Management and AI Chatbot System is guided by the following key principles:

### 2.1 Separation of Concerns

The system is designed with clear boundaries between document management, vector search, and AI response generation. Each component has well-defined responsibilities and interfaces, making the system easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

### 2.2 API-First Design

All functionality is exposed through well-defined REST APIs. This approach enables flexibility in client implementation and facilitates integration with other systems. The API design follows standard REST principles and includes comprehensive documentation.

### 2.3 Stateless Processing

Core processing components maintain minimal state for scalability. This stateless approach allows for horizontal scaling and improves system resilience. Where state is required, it is stored in persistent storage systems like the database or vector store.

### 2.4 Asynchronous Processing

Document processing and other resource-intensive operations are handled asynchronously to maintain system responsiveness. This approach prevents long-running operations from blocking API responses and improves user experience.

### 2.5 Data Isolation

The system maintains clear separation between document storage, vector database, and metadata. This isolation improves data management, security, and performance by using appropriate storage technologies for different data types.

### 2.6 Future-Ready Design

While initially implemented as a monolithic application, the architecture is designed with clear component boundaries to facilitate future migration to microservices if needed. This approach balances current simplicity with future scalability.

## 3. System Context
