Alerts are designed to be specific, actionable, and prioritized to enable efficient incident response.

### 4.2 Alert Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Monitoring System] --> B{Alert Condition}
    B -->|Triggered| C[Alert Manager]
    
    C --> D{Severity}
    D -->|Critical| E[Immediate Notification]
    D -->|Warning| F[Grouped Notification]
    D -->|Info| G[Dashboard Only]
    
    E --> H[On-Call Engineer]
    F --> I[Team Channel]
    G --> J[Status Dashboard]
    
    H --> K[Acknowledge Alert]
    K --> L[Investigate]
    L --> M[Resolve Issue]
    M --> N[Close Alert]
    N --> O[Post-Mortem]
```

The alert workflow defines how alerts are processed from detection to resolution:

1. Alert condition is detected by Prometheus or Loki
2. Alert is sent to AlertManager for processing
3. AlertManager routes the alert based on severity and type
4. Notification is sent to appropriate channels
5. On-call engineer acknowledges and investigates the alert
6. Issue is resolved and alert is closed
7. Post-mortem is conducted for critical incidents

This workflow ensures that alerts are handled efficiently and appropriately based on their severity and impact.

### 4.3 Alert Routing and Escalation

| Severity | Initial Notification | Escalation (15 min) | Escalation (1 hour) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | On-call engineer | Team lead | Engineering manager |
| Warning | Team channel | On-call engineer | Team lead |
| Info | Dashboard only | Team channel | No escalation |

Alert routing and escalation are configured in AlertManager to ensure that alerts are sent to the appropriate recipients and escalated if not acknowledged or resolved within defined timeframes.

Escalation paths are defined based on alert severity, with critical alerts having more aggressive escalation to ensure timely response.

### 4.4 Alert Notification Channels

The system uses multiple notification channels for alerts:

- **Slack**: Team channels for collaborative response
- **Email**: For non-urgent notifications and summaries

- Affected component and environment
- Links to relevant dashboards and runbooks
- Suggested initial actions

Notification channels are selected based on alert severity and time of day, with more intrusive channels used for critical alerts and during non-business hours.

### 4.5 Alert Suppression and Grouping

To reduce alert noise and fatigue, the system implements:

- **Alert Grouping**: Similar alerts are grouped into a single notification
- **Alert Suppression**: Alerts are suppressed during maintenance windows
- **Alert Deduplication**: Duplicate alerts are combined
- **Rate Limiting**: Limit on notification frequency for persistent issues

These mechanisms are configured in AlertManager to ensure that operators receive actionable notifications without being overwhelmed by alert noise.

## 5. Incident Response

The system defines clear procedures for responding to and resolving incidents:

### 5.1 Incident Classification

| Severity | Definition | Example | Initial Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Service outage | API unavailable | Immediate response |
| P2 | Degraded service | Slow search responses | Response within 1 hour |
| P3 | Minor issue | Occasional errors | Next business day |

Incidents are classified based on their impact on system functionality and users. Classification determines the response priority and escalation path.

### 5.2 Incident Response Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Alert Triggered] --> B[Initial Assessment]
    B --> C{Severity?}
    
    C -->|P1| D[Immediate Response]
    C -->|P2| E[Scheduled Response]
    C -->|P3| F[Backlog Item]
    
    D --> G[Incident Commander Assigned]
    G --> H[War Room Created]
    H --> I[Investigation]
    I --> J[Mitigation]
    J --> K[Resolution]
    K --> L[Post-Mortem]
    
    E --> M[Assign Owner]
    M --> N[Investigate]
    N --> O[Resolve]
    O --> P[Document Learnings]
    
    F --> Q[Track in Issue System]
    Q --> R[Address in Sprint]
```

The incident response workflow defines the process for handling incidents from initial detection to resolution and follow-up. The workflow varies based on incident severity, with more formal processes for high-severity incidents.

## 8. Logging Strategy

The system implements a structured logging strategy with consistent log levels and formats:

### 8.1 Log Levels

| Log Level | Usage | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ERROR | System errors requiring attention | Database connection failure |
| WARNING | Potential issues or degraded operation | Slow query performance |
| INFO | Normal operational events | Document uploaded successfully |
| DEBUG | Detailed information for troubleshooting | Query parameters and execution plan |

Log levels are used consistently across all components to indicate the severity and importance of logged events. In production, only ERROR, WARNING, and INFO logs are enabled by default, with DEBUG logs available for troubleshooting when needed.

### 8.2 Log Format

All logs include:

- Timestamp with timezone
- Log level
- Component/module identifier
- Correlation ID for request tracing
- Structured data relevant to the event
- User ID (where applicable, anonymized)

Logs are formatted as JSON to enable structured parsing and querying:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-06-15T14:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "component": "document_processor",
  "correlation_id": "c0rr3l4t10n1d",
  "message": "Document processing completed successfully",
  "document_id": "d0cum3nt1d",
  "processing_time_ms": 1250,
  "document_size_bytes": 1048576
}
```

This structured format enables efficient filtering, searching, and analysis of logs.

### 8.3 Log Collection

Logs are collected using Promtail agents deployed alongside application components. Promtail forwards logs to the central Loki service, which indexes and stores them for querying.

Log collection is configured to:

- Collect logs from all application components
- Add labels for component, environment, and instance
- Parse structured JSON logs
- Handle multi-line log entries
- Buffer logs during network issues

This approach ensures reliable collection and centralization of logs from all system components.

### 8.4 Log Retention

| Log Type | Retention Period | Storage | Archival |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Application Logs | 30 days | Loki | S3 (1 year) |
| Error Logs | 90 days | Loki | S3 (1 year) |
| Security Logs | 1 year | Loki | S3 (7 years) |
| Audit Logs | 1 year | Loki | S3 (7 years) |

Log retention policies balance operational needs with storage efficiency. Critical logs are retained for longer periods, with archival to cost-effective storage for compliance and historical analysis.

### 8.5 Log Querying

Logs are queried using LogQL in Grafana's Explore interface. Common query patterns include:

```logql
# All logs from the API service
{service="api"}

# Error logs from any service
{} |= "ERROR"

# Logs related to a specific document
{} |= "document_id=doc123"

# Logs with processing time over 5 seconds
{service="document_processor"} | json | processing_time_ms > 5000

# Logs for a specific correlation ID (request tracing)
{} |= "correlation_id=abc123"
```

These query patterns enable efficient log exploration and analysis, supporting both broad overview and targeted investigation.

### 8.6 Audit Logging

The system implements audit logging for security-sensitive operations:

| Operation | Audit Detail | Retention |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User Authentication | Username, IP, success/failure | 1 year |
| Document Access | User, document ID, action | 1 year |
| Configuration Changes | User, change details, timestamp | 1 year |
| Admin Actions | User, action, affected resources | 1 year |

Audit logs are stored separately from application logs and have longer retention periods to support security investigations and compliance requirements.

## 9. Metrics Definitions

The system defines standardized metrics across all components:

### 9.1 Request Metrics

| Metric Name | Type | Description | Labels |
