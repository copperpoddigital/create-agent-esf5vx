# Security Architecture

## 1. Introduction

The Document Management and AI Chatbot System implements a comprehensive security architecture designed to protect sensitive document data, user information, and system integrity. This document outlines the security principles, objectives, compliance requirements, and specific security controls implemented throughout the system.

### 1.1 Security Principles

The security architecture is guided by the following core security principles:

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls are implemented to protect the system. If one layer fails, other layers continue to provide protection.

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users and system components are granted the minimum level of access required to perform their functions, reducing the potential impact of compromised accounts or components.

- **Secure by Default**: Security is built into the system from the ground up, with secure defaults for all configurations and explicit opt-in for potentially risky features.

- **Privacy by Design**: Privacy considerations are incorporated into the system design from the beginning, ensuring that user data is protected throughout its lifecycle.

- **Zero Trust**: All access requests are authenticated and authorized regardless of the source, with continuous validation throughout user sessions.

### 1.2 Security Objectives

The security architecture aims to achieve the following primary objectives:

- **Confidentiality**: Protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access, including document content, user data, and system configuration.

- **Integrity**: Ensuring that data remains accurate and unaltered throughout its lifecycle, with protection against unauthorized modifications.

- **Availability**: Maintaining system uptime and performance while protecting against denial of service attacks and other threats to availability.

- **Accountability**: Providing comprehensive audit trails and logging to track user actions and system events, enabling forensic analysis and compliance reporting.

### 1.3 Compliance Requirements

The system is designed to meet the following compliance requirements:

- **Data Protection Regulations**: Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable data protection regulations, including data minimization, consent management, and right to be forgotten.

- **Industry Standards**: Adherence to security best practices outlined in standards such as OWASP Top 10, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and ISO 27001.

- **Internal Security Policies**: Alignment with organizational security policies, including access control, data classification, and incident response procedures.

- **Contractual Obligations**: Meeting security requirements specified in service level agreements (SLAs) and contracts with clients and partners.

## 2. Authentication Framework

The Document Management and AI Chatbot System implements a robust JWT-based authentication framework to secure API access and verify user identity.

### 2.1 JWT Implementation

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used as the primary authentication mechanism, providing a stateless and scalable approach to user authentication.

- **Token Structure**:
  - Header: Contains the signing algorithm (HS256)
  - Payload: Contains user ID, role, token expiration (exp), issued at time (iat)
  - Signature: HMAC-SHA256 signature created using a secure secret key

- **Signing Algorithm**: The system uses HMAC-SHA256 (HS256) for token signing, offering a good balance of security and performance.

- **Token Lifetime**:
  - Access Tokens: 60 minutes
  - Refresh Tokens: 7 days

- **Token Validation Process**:
  1. Extract token from Authorization header (Bearer scheme)
  2. Verify token signature using the secret key
  3. Check token expiration
  4. Extract user information and role

```python
# Example JWT payload structure
{
  "sub": "user-123",  # Subject (user ID)
  "role": "regular",  # User role
  "exp": 1673458800,  # Expiration timestamp
  "iat": 1673455200   # Issued at timestamp
}
```

### 2.2 Password Security

User passwords are securely stored and validated using industry-standard practices:

- **Password Hashing**: Argon2id algorithm is used for password hashing, with the following parameters:
  - Memory cost: 65536 KB
  - Time cost: 3 iterations
  - Parallelism: 4

- **Password Complexity Requirements**:
  - Minimum length: 10 characters
  - Must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character
  - No reuse of the last 5 passwords
  - Expiration: 90 days

- **Failed Attempt Handling**:
  - Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
  - Incrementally increasing delays between login attempts
  - Secure notification of suspicious login activity

### 2.3 Token Management

The system implements comprehensive token management to ensure secure authentication:

- **Token Creation**:
  - Generated upon successful authentication
  - Contains minimal necessary claims to limit token size
  - Signed with a secure server-side secret

- **Token Validation**:
  - Performed on every authenticated API request
  - Validates signature, expiration, and token structure
  - Implemented as middleware in the FastAPI application

- **Token Refresh**:
  - Uses a secure refresh token rotation pattern
  - Refresh tokens are invalidated after use
  - New access and refresh tokens are issued upon successful refresh

- **Token Revocation**:
  - Access tokens can be revoked in security incidents
  - Refresh tokens stored in database with revocation flag
  - Support for token blacklisting in high-security scenarios

### 2.4 Authentication Workflow

The authentication process follows these steps:

1. **User Login**:
   - User submits credentials (username/password)
   - System validates credentials against stored password hash
   - On success, generates and returns JWT access token and refresh token

2. **Authenticated Requests**:
   - Client includes JWT token in Authorization header
   - System validates token on each request
   - Request processing continues if token is valid

3. **Token Refresh**:
   - Client submits refresh token when access token expires
   - System validates refresh token and issues new token pair
   - Old refresh token is invalidated

4. **Logout**:
   - Client discards tokens
   - Refresh token is invalidated in the database
   - Optional: Access token added to short-term blacklist

        API-->>User: Response
    else Invalid Token
        API-->>User: 401 Unauthorized
    end
```

## 3. Authorization System

The Document Management and AI Chatbot System implements a role-based access control (RBAC) system to ensure users can only access resources and perform actions appropriate to their role.

### 3.1 Role Definitions

The system defines the following roles with specific permission sets:

- **Admin**:
  - Full system access
  - User management capabilities
  - Access to all documents and queries
  - System configuration rights
  - Analytics and reporting access

- **Regular User**:
  - Document upload, search, and management
  - Access to own documents and shared documents
  - Query submission and feedback
  - Profile management
  - Limited analytics access

- **Guest**:
  - Limited search functionality
  - No document upload capability
  - No access to user-specific features
  - No feedback capabilities

Each role has explicitly defined permissions in the system, following the principle of least privilege.

### 3.2 Permission Matrix

The following matrix details the permissions assigned to each role:

| Resource/Operation | Admin | Regular User | Guest |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Documents** |
| Upload Document | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| List Documents | All | Own + Shared | ✗ |
| View Document | All | Own + Shared | ✗ |
| Delete Document | All | Own | ✗ |
| **Search/Query** |
| Submit Query | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (limited) |
| View Query History | All | Own | ✗ |
| **Feedback** |
| Submit Feedback | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| View Feedback | All | Own | ✗ |
| **User Management** |
| Create User | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Update User | All | Self | ✗ |
| Delete User | All | Self | ✗ |
| **System Configuration** |
| View Configuration | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Update Configuration | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |

### 3.3 Implementation Approach

Authorization is implemented using FastAPI's dependency injection system, which provides a clean and efficient way to enforce role-based access control.

- **Role-Based Middleware**:
  - Custom middleware checks user roles and permissions
  - Integrated with FastAPI dependency injection
  - Applied at endpoint level for granular control

- **Implementation Pattern**:

```python
# Pseudocode example for authorization implementation
def require_role(allowed_roles: List[str]):
    def dependency(token: str = Depends(get_token)):
        payload = decode_jwt(token)
        if payload["role"] not in allowed_roles:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Permission denied")
        return payload
    return dependency

# Usage example
@app.post("/documents/upload")
async def upload_document(
    file: UploadFile,
    user: dict = Depends(require_role(["admin", "regular"]))
):
    # Implementation
```

- **Permission Checking**:
  - Role verification on each protected endpoint
  - Additional resource-level permissions where needed
  - Comprehensive validation before any protected operation

### 3.4 Resource Authorization

Beyond role-based permissions, the system implements resource-level authorization to ensure users can only access their own resources or resources explicitly shared with them.

- **Resource Ownership**:
  - Each resource (document, query, feedback) is associated with an owner
  - Ownership is established during resource creation
  - Queries check ownership before granting access

- **Resource Sharing**:
  - Documents can be explicitly shared with other users
  - Sharing creates permission records in the database
  - Access checks validate direct ownership or shared access

- **Implementation Approach**:

```python
# Pseudocode for resource authorization
async def check_document_access(document_id: UUID, user_id: UUID):
    # Check if user owns the document
    document = await get_document(document_id)
    if document.owner_id == user_id:
        return True
        
    # Check if document is shared with user
    shared = await get_document_sharing(document_id, user_id)
    if shared:
        return True
        
    # No access
    return False
```

- **Administration Override**:
  - Administrators can access all resources
  - Administrative access is logged for audit purposes
  - Special permissions can be granted for specific resources

## 4. Data Protection

The Document Management and AI Chatbot System implements multiple layers of data protection to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information.

### 4.1 Encryption Standards

The system employs industry-standard encryption algorithms to protect data throughout its lifecycle:

- **Data at Rest**:
  - Algorithm: AES-256
  - Implementation: Transparent database encryption
  - Key storage: Secure key management service

- **Data in Transit**:
  - Protocol: TLS 1.3
  - Ciphers: ECDHE with P-256 curves

  - Master Key: Used to encrypt all other keys
  - Document Encryption Keys (DEKs): Individual keys for document content
  - Token Encryption Key (TEK): Used for token signing

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Key Hierarchy"
        MK[Master Key] --> DEK1[Document Encryption Key 1]
        MK --> DEK2[Document Encryption Key 2]
        MK --> DEK3[Document Encryption Key 3]
        MK --> TEK[Token Encryption Key]
    end
    
    subgraph "Key Storage"
        MK --> KMS[Key Management Service]
        DEK1 --> DB[(Encrypted in Database)]
        DEK2 --> DB
        DEK3 --> DB
        TEK --> MS[Memory Store]
    end
    
    subgraph "Key Rotation"
        KR[Key Rotation Service] --> MK
        KR --> DEK1
        KR --> DEK2
        KR --> DEK3
        KR --> TEK
    end
```

- **Key Storage**:
  - Master keys stored in a dedicated key management service
  - Document encryption keys stored encrypted in the database
  - Application keys loaded securely into memory

- **Key Rotation Policies**:
  - Master key: Rotated annually
  - Document encryption keys: Rotated upon request or suspected compromise
  - Token signing key: Rotated quarterly

- **Key Backup Procedures**:
  - Secure offline backup of master keys
  - Key recovery procedures documented and tested
  - Split knowledge procedures for critical key recovery

### 4.3 Data Masking

The system implements data masking rules to protect sensitive information in logs, reports, and user interfaces:

- **Email Addresses**:
  - Display format: user\*\*\*@domain.com
  - Implementation: Custom masking function
  - Application: Logs, user interfaces, exports

- **Document Content**:
  - Method: Context-based redaction
  - Implementation: Automated PII detection and masking
  - Application: Previews, search results, responses

- **User Activity**:
  - Method: Aggregation and anonymization
  - Implementation: Statistical summaries without individual identification
  - Application: Analytics, reports, dashboards

- **Implementation Example**:

```python
# Pseudocode for email masking
def mask_email(email: str) -> str:
    if not email or '@' not in email:
        return email
    
    username, domain = email.split('@', 1)
    if len(username) <= 3:
        masked_username = username[0] + '*' * len(username[1:])
    else:
        masked_username = username[0:3] + '*' * len(username[3:])
    
    return f"{masked_username}@{domain}"
```

### 4.4 Secure Communication

All communication within the system and with external services is secured using strong encryption and secure protocols:

- **Transport Layer Security**:
  - TLS 1.3 for all HTTP traffic
  - Perfect forward secrecy with ECDHE key exchange
  - Strong cipher suites (ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384)

- **API Security**:
  - HTTPS-only API endpoints
  - HSTS headers to enforce secure connections
  - Certificate pinning for mobile clients

- **External Service Communication**:
  - Mutual TLS for critical service integrations
  - API keys transmitted over secure channels
  - Regular rotation of service credentials

- **Internal Communication**:
  - Service-to-service authentication
  - Encrypted inter-service communication
  - Network segmentation to isolate services

## 5. Security Zones

The system architecture is divided into security zones with appropriate controls at each boundary to implement defense in depth.

### 5.1 Network Architecture

The network security architecture consists of multiple security zones with controlled data flows between them:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Public Zone"
        Client[Client Applications]
    end
    
    subgraph "DMZ"
        LB[Load Balancer]
        WAF[Web Application Firewall]
        API[API Gateway]
    end
    
    subgraph "Application Zone"
        Auth[Authentication Service]
        Doc[Document Service]
        Search[Search Service]
        Feedback[Feedback Service]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Zone"
        DB[(PostgreSQL)]
        FAISS[(FAISS Vector DB)]
        FS[(File Storage)]
    end
    
    subgraph "External Services Zone"
        LLM[LLM Service]
    end
    
    Client -->|HTTPS| LB
    LB --> WAF
    WAF --> API
    
    API --> Auth
    API --> Doc
    API --> Search
    API --> Feedback
    
    Auth --> DB
    Doc --> DB
    Doc --> FS
    Search --> DB
    Search --> FAISS
    Search --> LLM
    Feedback --> DB
```

- **Public Zone**: 
  - Contains client applications and external systems
  - Accessible from the internet
  - Limited to HTTPS traffic on standard ports

- **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)**:
  - Contains load balancers, WAF, and API gateway
  - Filters and inspects incoming traffic
  - Terminates TLS connections and establishes new ones to internal services

- **Application Zone**:
  - Contains application components and services
  - Not directly accessible from the internet
  - Enforces service-to-service authentication

- **Data Zone**:
  - Contains databases and storage systems
  - Highly restricted access
  - Accessible only from the Application Zone

- **External Services Zone**:
  - Contains third-party services like LLM APIs
  - Secured with API keys and IP restrictions

## 6. Threat Mitigation

The system implements specific controls to mitigate common security threats and vulnerabilities.

### 6.1 SQL Injection Prevention

SQL injection attacks are prevented through comprehensive database security measures:

- **ORM Usage**:
  - SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
  - Parameterized queries for all database operations
  - No direct string concatenation for SQL

- **Implementation Example**:

```python
# Secure approach with SQLAlchemy ORM
async def get_document(document_id: UUID, user_id: UUID):
    query = select(Document).where(
        and_(
            Document.id == document_id,
            Document.owner_id == user_id
        )
    )
    result = await db.execute(query)
    return result.scalar_one_or_none()

# Instead of vulnerable string concatenation:
# f"SELECT * FROM documents WHERE id = '{document_id}' AND owner_id = '{user_id}'"
```

- **Additional Protections**:
  - Input validation before database operations
  - Database user with minimal privileges
  - Regular security scanning for SQL injection vulnerabilities

### 6.2 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection

The system protects against XSS vulnerabilities through multiple layers of defense:

- **Input Validation**:
  - Pydantic models for request validation
  - Data type checking and constraints
  - Rejection of malicious input patterns

- **Output Encoding**:
  - Context-appropriate HTML escaping
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
  - Safe templating practices

- **Response Headers**:
  - Content-Type headers with correct charset
  - X-XSS-Protection header for compatible browsers
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

- **Content Security Policy Example**:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none';
```

### 6.3 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

CSRF attacks are mitigated through the following controls:

- **Token Pattern**:
  - Double Submit Cookie pattern for state-changing operations
  - CSRF tokens with appropriate timeout
  - Validation on all non-idempotent operations

- **Implementation Approach**:

```python
# Pseudocode for CSRF protection
@app.post("/documents/upload")
async def upload_document(
    file: UploadFile,
    csrf_token: str = Form(...),
    user: dict = Depends(require_role(["admin", "regular"]))
):
    # Validate CSRF token
    if not validate_csrf_token(csrf_token, user["sub"]):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Invalid CSRF token")
    
    # Process the upload
    # ...
```

- **Additional Protections**:
  - SameSite=Lax cookie attribute
  - Origin and Referer header validation
  - Short CSRF token lifetimes

### 6.4 Rate Limiting

The system implements rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks, API abuse, and denial of service:

- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Redis-based token bucket algorithm
  - Different rate limits based on endpoint sensitivity
  - User-based and IP-based rate limiting

- **Rate Limit Configuration**:

| Client Type | Rate Limit | Timeframe | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anonymous | 10 requests | Per minute | IP-based limiting |
| Authenticated | 60 requests | Per minute | User-based limiting |
| Admin | 120 requests | Per minute | Role-based limiting |

- **Additional Protections**:
  - Exponential backoff for authentication failures
  - Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
  - Notification of suspicious activity

### 6.5 Prompt Injection Protection

The system implements measures to prevent prompt injection attacks in LLM interactions:

- **Input Sanitization**:
  - Filtering of potentially malicious prompt patterns
  - Validation of query inputs
  - Removal of control characters and formatting

- **Context Boundaries**:
  - Clear separation between system prompts and user input
  - Structured prompts with defined roles
  - Validation of LLM responses

- **Implementation Example**:

```python
# Pseudocode for prompt injection protection
def create_safe_prompt(user_query: str, context: str) -> str:
    # Sanitize user query
    sanitized_query = sanitize_input(user_query)
    
    # Create prompt with clear boundaries
    prompt = f"""
System: You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided document context.
Only use information from the provided context to answer the question.
If the context doesn't contain relevant information, say "I don't have enough information to answer this question."

Context:
{context}

```

## 8. Security Testing

The Document Management and AI Chatbot System undergoes regular security testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.

### 8.1 Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

SAST is performed automatically in the CI/CD pipeline to identify code-level security issues:

- **Implementation**:

The system uses a `SecuritySettings` class to manage security-related configuration:

```python
# Pseudocode for SecuritySettings class
class SecuritySettings:
    # JWT Configuration
    jwt_secret: str
    jwt_algorithm: str = "HS256"
    access_token_expire_minutes: int = 60
    refresh_token_expire_days: int = 7
    
    # Password Policy
    password_min_length: int = 10
    password_require_uppercase: bool = True
    password_require_lowercase: bool = True
    password_require_digit: bool = True
    password_require_special: bool = True
    password_expiry_days: int = 90
    password_history_count: int = 5
    
    # Authentication Security
    max_failed_attempts: int = 5
    lockout_duration_minutes: int = 30
    
    # API Security
    rate_limit_anonymous: int = 10
    rate_limit_authenticated: int = 60
    rate_limit_admin: int = 120
    
    # Encryption Configuration
    encryption_algorithm: str = "AES-256-GCM"
    
    # Security Headers
    security_headers: Dict[str, str] = {
        "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
        "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
        "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'",
        "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains",
