histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, endpoint))

# Request rate by endpoint
sum(rate(request_count[5m])) by (endpoint)

# Error rate by endpoint
sum(rate(request_count{status_code=~"5.."}[5m])) by (endpoint) / sum(rate(request_count[5m])) by (endpoint)
```

**Document Processing**:

```promql
# Document processing rate
rate(documents_processed_total[5m])

### 3.3 Log Structure and Format

The system uses structured JSON logging for all components. Logs are collected by Promtail and stored in Loki.

**Log Levels**:

| Log Level | Usage | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ERROR | System errors requiring attention | Database connection failure |
| WARNING | Potential issues or degraded operation | Slow query performance |
| INFO | Normal operational events | Document uploaded successfully |
| DEBUG | Detailed information for troubleshooting | Query parameters and execution plan |

**Log Format**:

All logs are formatted as JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-06-15T14:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "component": "document_processor",
  "correlation_id": "c0rr3l4t10n1d",
  "message": "Document processing completed successfully",
  "document_id": "d0cum3nt1d",
  "processing_time_ms": 1250,
  "document_size_bytes": 1048576
}
```

Key fields in the log format:

- `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp with millisecond precision
- `level`: Log level (ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG)
- `component`: System component generating the log
- `correlation_id`: Unique ID for request tracing across components
- `message`: Human-readable log message
- Additional context-specific fields

**Log Retention**:

| Log Type | Retention Period |
| --- | --- |
| Application Logs | 14 days |
| Error Logs | 30 days |
| Security Logs | 90 days |
| Audit Logs | 365 days |

Log retention is configured in Loki and can be adjusted based on storage capacity and compliance requirements.

### 3.4 Common LogQL Queries

Common LogQL queries for log analysis and troubleshooting:

**General Queries**:

```logql
# All logs from a specific component
{component="api"}

# All error logs
{} |= "ERROR"

# Logs for a specific correlation ID (request tracing)
{} |= "correlation_id=abc123"
```

**API Errors**:

```logql
# API errors
{component="api"} |= "ERROR"

# Authentication failures
{component="api"} |= "authentication failed" or {component="api"} |= "invalid token"

# Rate limiting events
{component="api"} |= "rate limit exceeded"
```

**Document Processing**:

```logql
# Document processing errors
{component="document_processor"} |= "ERROR"

# Slow document processing
{component="document_processor"} | json | processing_time_ms > 5000

# PDF extraction issues
{component="document_processor"} |= "extraction failed"
```

**Vector Search**:

```logql
# Vector search errors
{component="vector_search"} |= "ERROR"

# Slow searches
{component="vector_search"} | json | search_time_ms > 3000

# FAISS index issues
{component="vector_search"} |= "index error"
```

**LLM Integration**:

```logql
# LLM service errors
{component="llm_service"} |= "ERROR"

{} |= "permission denied" or {} |= "unauthorized access"

# Suspicious activity
{} |= "suspicious" or {} |= "security violation"
```

These queries can be used in Grafana's Explore interface or in Loki's query interface.

### 3.5 Correlation Between Metrics and Logs

The monitoring system enables correlation between metrics and logs for comprehensive troubleshooting:

**Correlation Techniques**:

1. **Correlation IDs**:
   - Each request is assigned a unique correlation ID
   - The correlation ID is included in all logs related to the request
   - Use the correlation ID to trace a request across components

2. **Timestamp Correlation**:
   - Use timestamps to correlate metrics spikes with log events
   - In Grafana, click on a metrics spike to view logs from the same time period

3. **Component and Instance Correlation**:
   - Use component and instance labels to correlate metrics and logs
   - Filter logs by the same component showing issues in metrics

**Example Correlation Workflow**:

1. Identify a performance issue in metrics (e.g., high API latency)
2. Note the time period and affected component
3. Query logs for the same time period and component
4. Look for error patterns or warnings
5. If a specific request is identified, use its correlation ID to trace it across components

**Grafana Correlation Features**:

Grafana provides built-in features for correlating metrics and logs:

1. In a metrics dashboard, click on a data point
2. Select "View logs around this time"
3. Grafana will show logs from the same time period
4. Use the same labels to filter logs as used in the metrics query

This correlation capability enables efficient root cause analysis for system issues.

### 3.6 Distributed Tracing

The system uses distributed tracing to track request flows across components:

**Trace Collection**:

- OpenTelemetry instrumentation in application code
- Trace data sent to Tempo
- Sampling rate configured based on traffic volume

**Key Trace Points**:

1. **API Requests**:
   - Incoming HTTP requests
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Request validation
   - Response generation

2. **Document Processing**:
   - Document upload
   - Text extraction
   - Vector embedding generation
   - FAISS index updates

3. **Vector Search**:
   - Query embedding generation
   - FAISS similarity search
   - Result processing

4. **LLM Integration**:
   - Context preparation
   - OpenAI API calls
   - Response processing

5. **Database Operations**:
   - Query execution
   - Transaction management

**Accessing Traces**:

1. In Grafana, navigate to Explore > Tempo
2. Search for traces by:
   - Service name
   - Operation name
   - Duration threshold
   - Trace ID (from logs)

**Analyzing Traces**:

1. View the trace timeline to identify slow operations
2. Expand spans to see detailed timing information
3. View span attributes for context information
4. Follow links between spans to understand the request flow

**Correlation with Logs and Metrics**:

- Trace IDs are included in logs as correlation IDs
- Use trace IDs to find related logs
- Compare trace durations with metrics for the same operations

Distributed tracing is particularly valuable for diagnosing performance issues in complex request flows.

   - Test changes in development environment
   - Get peer review for significant changes
   - Communicate changes to users

**User Feedback**:

1. **Collecting Feedback**:
   - Provide a feedback mechanism
   - Regularly solicit user input
   - Track dashboard usage statistics

2. **Implementing Improvements**:
   - Prioritize user-requested changes
   - Implement changes in development first
   - Validate improvements with users

## 5. Alerting and Notification

This section covers the alerting system configuration, notification channels, and alert response procedures.

### 5.1 Alert Rules

The system includes the following key alert rules:

| Alert Name | Condition | Severity | Response Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API High Error Rate | Error rate > 5% for 5 minutes | Critical | 15 minutes |
| API High Latency | 95th percentile latency > 3s for 10 minutes | Warning | 1 hour |
| Document Processing Failure | Failed document processing > 3 consecutive | Warning | 1 hour |
| Document Processing Backlog | Processing queue > 100 for 15 minutes | Warning | 1 hour |
| FAISS Search Latency | Search time > 2s for 10 minutes | Warning | 4 hours |
| Database Connection Issues | Connection failures > 3 in 5 minutes | Critical | 30 minutes |
| Database High CPU | Database CPU > 80% for 15 minutes | Warning | 1 hour |
| LLM Service Unavailable | Service unreachable for 2 minutes | Critical | 15 minutes |
| LLM High Error Rate | Error rate > 10% for 5 minutes | Warning | 1 hour |
| High CPU Usage | CPU > 80% for 15 minutes | Warning | 1 hour |
| High Memory Usage | Memory > 80% for 15 minutes | Warning | 1 hour |
| Disk Space Low | Disk space < 20% | Warning | 4 hours |
| Disk Space Critical | Disk space < 10% | Critical | 30 minutes |
| Deployment Failure | Deployment status is failure | Critical | 15 minutes |
| Post-Deployment Error Spike | Error rate increases 200% after deployment | Critical | 15 minutes |

**Alert Rule Configuration**:

Alert rules are defined in Prometheus using PromQL expressions. Example alert rule configuration:

```yaml
groups:
- name: api_alerts
  rules:
  - alert: APIHighErrorRate
    expr: sum(rate(request_count{status_code=~"5.."}[5m])) / sum(rate(request_count[5m])) > 0.05
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: "High API error rate"
      description: "API error rate is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} for the past 5 minutes"
      dashboard: "https://grafana.example.com/d/api-performance"
