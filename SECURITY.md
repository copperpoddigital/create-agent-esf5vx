# Security Policy for Document Management and AI Chatbot System

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Document Management and AI Chatbot System seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to security@example.com. If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key, which can be found at [security-pgp-key.asc](https://example.com/security-pgp-key.asc).

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any potential mitigations you've identified
- Whether you'd like to be acknowledged in our security advisories

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and will send you regular updates about our progress. We aim to resolve all vulnerabilities within 90 days of the initial report.

## Supported Versions

We release security patches for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

Only the latest patch version of each supported minor version will receive security updates.

## Security Practices

The Document Management and AI Chatbot System implements the following security practices:

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization
- Password storage using Argon2id hashing algorithm
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms

### Data Protection
- TLS 1.3 encryption for all data in transit
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest
- Data minimization principles applied throughout the system
- Secure handling of document content and vector embeddings

### Application Security
- Input validation for all API endpoints
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure file handling for document uploads

### Infrastructure Security
- Regular security patching of all components
- Network segmentation and access controls
- Container security with minimal base images
- Principle of least privilege for all service accounts

### Monitoring and Incident Response
- Comprehensive security logging
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Defined incident response procedures
- Regular security testing

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as needed based on the severity of the vulnerabilities:

- **Critical**: Immediate patch release within 24-48 hours
- **High**: Patch release within 1 week
- **Medium**: Included in the next scheduled release
- **Low**: Addressed in a future release

Security advisories are published for all vulnerabilities through:

1. GitHub Security Advisories
2. Release notes

## Security Compliance

The Document Management and AI Chatbot System is designed with the following compliance considerations:

- **Data Protection**: Compliant with data protection regulations through encryption, access controls, and data minimization
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for security-relevant events
- **Authentication**: Strong authentication mechanisms with configurable policies
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular scanning and patching of vulnerabilities

For specific compliance requirements or questions, please contact security@example.com.

## Security Development Lifecycle

We integrate security throughout our development process:

1. **Design Phase**: Threat modeling and security requirements
2. **Development**: Secure coding practices and peer reviews
3. **Testing**: Security testing including SAST, DAST, and dependency scanning
4. **Deployment**: Secure configuration and vulnerability scanning
5. **Maintenance**: Regular security updates and monitoring

Our CI/CD pipeline includes automated security checks that must pass before code can be merged or deployed.
