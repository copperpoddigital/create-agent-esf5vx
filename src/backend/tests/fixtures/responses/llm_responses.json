    "response_text": "Based on the documents I've reviewed, the answer to your question is that document management systems help organizations store, track, and manage electronic documents efficiently. These systems typically include features such as version control, metadata tagging, and search capabilities. According to Document 1, modern document management systems also incorporate AI capabilities to enhance searchability and information extraction."

  "ai_definition_response": {
    "response_text": "According to the documents I've analyzed, Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning from data (machine learning), recognizing patterns, understanding natural language, and making decisions. Document 2 specifically mentions that modern AI systems like large language models (LLMs) can process and generate human-like text, making them valuable for applications such as document analysis, question answering, and content generation. The document also notes that AI is increasingly being integrated into document management systems to improve search relevance and information extraction capabilities."

  "vector_database_response": {
    "response_text": "Based on the information in Document 3, vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and efficiently query high-dimensional vector embeddings. These databases are optimized for similarity search operations, which are crucial for semantic search functionality. The document explains that vector databases like FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) use techniques such as approximate nearest neighbor search to quickly find similar vectors even in datasets with millions of entries. Vector databases are a key component in modern document retrieval systems because they allow for searching based on semantic meaning rather than just keywords. This enables more intuitive and relevant search results when querying document collections."
  },
  "document_management_response": {
    "response_text": "According to Documents 1 and 4, document management systems are software solutions designed to organize, store, and control document-centric information within organizations. Key features highlighted in the documents include: 1) Centralized storage for easy access and retrieval, 2) Version control to track document history and changes, 3) Metadata tagging for improved searchability, 4) Access controls to manage who can view or modify documents, and 5) Integration with workflow systems for document routing and approvals. Modern document management systems are increasingly incorporating AI capabilities such as automatic classification, entity extraction, and semantic search to enhance functionality and user experience. The documents also emphasize that effective document management can lead to improved productivity, better compliance with regulations, and reduced storage costs."
