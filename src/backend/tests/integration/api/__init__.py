"""
API Integration Tests Package for the Document Management and AI Chatbot System.

This package contains integration tests that verify the correct interaction between
API endpoints and various system components, including:
- Document upload and processing
- Vector search functionality
- LLM-powered query responses
- User feedback collection
- Authentication and authorization

Integration tests in this package focus on testing the API layer with realistic
but controlled interactions between components, ensuring that the endpoints
function correctly as part of the complete system.
