"""
Unit tests for the API layer of the Document Management and AI Chatbot System.

This package contains tests for API endpoints, request validation, authentication,
error handling, and other API-related functionality.

Tests in this package focus on isolated testing of API routes without integrating
with actual database or external services. Dependencies are mocked to ensure
true unit testing of the API layer.
